### Socratic Seminar Planning

**Provided Question 1: How do minor characters in Brother contribute to the novel’s action and themes?**
Aisha:
- Enforces the idea that education = successful, proving mother is correct (ties in at the end when Francis states music is useless)
- Pushes Michael to reconsider and face the past
- Shows different way of dealing with grief
Jelly:
- Pushes Francis to pursue music
- Advances plot (has a goal)
Other friends as Desaria's Barbershop:
- Supports emotionally
- Reinforces community spirit
Members of the community:
- Supports Michael's family 
- Opposes them by enforcing stereotypes onto them.
Cops/Bouncers/Music festival organizers:
- Advances plot (major events stems from conflicts)
- Enforces racism theme
Ruth's family:
- Relating to origin, further relatability/realism of characters
- Touches on immigrant experience

**Provided Question 2: To what extent are people ruled by emotion rather than reason? With what results?**
- Michael avoiding grief
	- Knowing remembering Francis is the right thing to do.
	- Pushing people away
- Ruth and Francis both ruled by emotion does not comes to terms -> leaves regret.
- The people in the neighborhood, sees Michael and Francis more by prejudice than reason
- Cops, bouncer, etc are ruled more by emotion and prejudice than by reason of arrest 
- Francis holds knife in confrontation
- Francis punches the bouncer
- Francis gets shot by police

**Thematic Question 1: To what extent do family, friends, and community support or oppose us when dealing with challenges.**
Family
- Supports us (Francis, Mother, Michael all support each other 3 ways)
	- As the big brother, Francis looks out for Michael and teaches him about the world
		- Stands up for Michael during a fight (711 Bus stop scene)
		- Lead Michael in doing stuff with him (watching cartoons, hanging out with friends, concert)
		- Teaches Michael Things, tells him what's right or wrong
	- Ruth supports Francis and Michael 
		- Works long hours to provide food
		- Guides them to what she believes is right
		- Tries to make time for family bonding (reading stories, comforting Francis in nightmares)
	- Francis supports Ruth
		- Tries to help her work and in supporting Michael
		- Sends her stuff
	- Michael supports Ruth
- Oppose us (mother oppose Francis, Francis oppose mother)
	- Opposing ideas
		- Different ideas in "opportunity", both with valid reasoning
		- Mother is strict towards the boys, tries to shelter them from the "bad" people of the neighborhood
	- Due to immigration = working a lot, not providing good support for getting a good education / parents don't have good resources.
Friends
- Support each other.
- May also oppose (Francis at end, “Bad kids”)
Community
- Supports (bring food, somewhat united)
- Opposes (rumors, bad reputation, everyone hates each other)

**Thematic Question 2: In what ways does the novel depict the immigrant experience?**
How do Ruth’s struggles as a mother reflect broader challenges faced by immigrant families?
- Mother working
- Need money
- Old fashioned: very strict, opportunity = education, doesn't allow Francis and Michael to do stuff. 
	- However, single mother means she has to both provide and care for them
	- Works long hours so can't really influence them a lot, slowly ideas of opportunity becomes different
	- As a young child, if you are not under strict parental control, especially in such a neighborhood, it is easy to get involved with ... not "bad" but like "nontraditional" stuff, stuff that an immigrant parent would tell you is not right.
What does the novel suggest about immigrants and their relationship between race, class, and opportunity? How do these forces affect the futures of Michael and Francis?
- Music (not given opportunity, main conflict)
- School (opportunity)
	- Aisha
- Cops
	- Facing prejudice checks, carding, several examples

**Literacy Question 1: How does the description of the settings support the themes?**

**Literacy Question 2: How does the author's shifts between the past and the present connect ideas?**
