### Inequalities and Symmetry
##### Set and Interval Notation
$\{x | 0 < x < \infty \}$ and $(0,\infty)$.
##### Solving Linear Inequalities
$y= 2x+4, y>0 \rightarrow 2x+4 > 0$. 
##### Solving quadratic inequalities
**Steps:** 
- Factor quadratic and find zeros.
- Make a table, split $(-\infty,\infty)$ with it's zeros into intervals and put to left, split the quadratic into it's factors (linear) and put on top.
- For each grid, check if interval is positive or negative for the given linear factor on top.
- For the final column we put $f(x)$ on top. It is positive if there were even number of negative signs in that row. Negative if odd number of negative signs.
##### Symmetry
**Even function:** when $f(x) = f(-x)$ for all $x$. ==Symmetric respect to y-axis==.
**Odd function:** when $f(x)=-f(-x)$ for all $x$. ==Symmetric respect to origin== (rotated $180^{\circ}$). 

### Vertical Asymptotes

$f(x)$ has vertical asymptote at $x = a$ if $f(x)$ approaches infinity from either sides when $x$ approaches $a$. More formally, it must satisfy
$$
\begin{align}
\lim_{x \rightarrow a^+} f(x) &= \pm \infty \\
&\textnormal{ or } \\
\lim_{x \rightarrow a^-} f(x) &= \pm \infty
\end{align}
$$
and thus $f(a)$ is undefined at that point. If this doesn't work, but $x=a$ is undefined, then $x=a$ is a **point of discontinuity**.

Proof using $[0^+]$ and $[0^-]$ on the bottom and $\rightarrow$ signs in WR.

### Horizontal Asymptotes
$f(x)$ has horizontal asymptote at $y=c$ if graph gets infinitely close to $c$ as $x$ tends to either $\pm \infty$. More formally,
$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow \pm \infty} f(x) = c.
$$
Check for both $-\infty$ and $\infty$ by plugging it into the limit. Use "divide by largest degree" trick for polynomial fractions.
In WR, must say "H.A. at $y = \frac{a}{b}$."

**Might approach from below the asymptote even if it started from top.**
- Check both left ($x=a^-$) and right $(x=a^+)$ for all asymptotes with C.N at $a$.
- If this happens, it intersects horizontal asymptote, goes down (like parabola), then goes back again to approach asymptote. 
- Prove using $[small]$ and $[smaller]$ for whether $\lim_{x \rightarrow \pm \infty} f(x)$ is bigger or less than $c$ (for whether it approaches from top or bottom). 


### Intervals of Increase and Decrease
**Steps:**
- Step 1: Get first derivative $f'(x)$.
- Step 2: Find C.N where $f'(x) = 0$ or $f'(x) = UNDEF$. 
- Step 3: Interval Table by splitting up with C.N and find if $f(x)$ is $INC$ or $DEC$ using sign (positive or negative) of $f'(x)$. Note we only care about the sign of $f'(x)$, so we should put the factors of $f'(x)$ on top.
- Step 4: Summary Sentence: "$f(x)$ is increasing on $(a,b) \cup (c,d)$ and decreasing on $(e,f)$. "


### Maximum and Minimum Values

**Absolute maximum/minimum** at $x=c$ if $f(c)$ is the max/min value of the entire graph.
**Local maximum** at $x=c$ if $f(c) \ge f(x)$ for all $x$ in interval $(a,b)$. Usually this interval is "near" $c$, hence local max.
- Occurs when function switches from $INC$ to $DEC$.
**Local minimum** at $x=c$ if $f(c) \le f(x)$ for all $x$ in interval $(a,b)$. 
- Occurs when function switches from $DEC$ to $INC$. 

Local Max/Min may (though not always) occur at **critical numbers**.
- Step 4: Find Local Max/Min using table in Step 3. Get the $x$ value (desired C.N) and plug it into $f(x)$ to get $y$ value.
- Step 5: Summary Sentence 
	- $f(x)$ is increasing on ...
	- $f(x)$ is decreasing on...
	- Local Max: $P(a,b)$
	- Local Min: $Q(c,d)$

Absolute Max is just max value of all local max plus ==compare the endpoints==. An Absolute Max doesn't exist if as $x$ tends to $\pm \infty$, $y$ tends to $\infty$. Same ideas for Absolute Min. 

**Second Derivative Test:** 
- If $f'(c) = 0$ (tangent) and $f''(c)<0$ (concave down), then $f(x)$ has local maximum at $x = c$.
- If $f'(c) = 0$ (tangent) and $f''(c)>0$ (concave up), then $f(x)$ has local minimum at $x = c$.

### Concavity and Points of Inflection
Test for concavity:
- $f''(x) >0$, then local interval is concave up (upward parabola)
- $f''(x)<0$, then local interval is concave down (downward parabola)
- $f''(x) = 0, UNDEF$, then a change in concavity occurs

Steps:
- Find second derivative
- Get C.N where $f''(x) = 0, UNDEF$
- Make table for whether $f''(x)$ is positive or negative using intervals of C.N
- Find inflection points (occurs at changes in concavity) and plug in $x$ value to get $y=f(x)$ value on the original graph to determine the coordinates of inflection points.
- Summary Statement: $f(x)$ is C.D on $(a,b)$ and C.U on $(c,d)$. Inflection Points at $P(m,n)$.

### Curve Sketching
Determine:
- Domain 
- X and Y Intercepts
- Vertical and Horizontal Asymptotes
- Intervals of INC/DEC with local min/max points
- Intervals of CU/CD with points of inflection
Then sketch graph. 
**Note: check if local min/max points and points of inflection are in the domain before graphing**.
**Note: Change scale when needed.**
**Note: Draw arrows for going outside the graph.**
**Note: $P(m,n)$**

### 3.1 Extended Law of Sines

Another way to relate angles and lengths (other than similar triangles) is **law of sines**. 

**Theorem 3.1 (The Extended Law of Sines): In triangle $ABC$ with circumradius $R$, we have**
$$
	\frac{a}{\sin{A}} = \frac{b}{\sin{B}} = \frac{c}{\sin{C}} = 2R.
$$

Normal sin law (trivial proof) but with $2R$ at the end. We prove $\frac{a}{\sin{A}} = 2R$ and the rest follows. $2R$ suggests drawing the circumcircle. Let $BX$ be a diameter of circumcircle $(ABC)$. The directed angle $\measuredangle BXC = \measuredangle BAC$. Moreover, $\triangle BXC$ is right at $\angle C$. $BC = a, BX = 2R$, and $\angle BXC = A \textnormal{ or } 180^{\circ} - A$. Since it must be that $\angle A  < 180^{\circ}$ to for a non-degenerate triangle, $\sin{A} = \sin{BXC} = \frac{a}{2R}$.  

**Theorem 3.2 (Angle Bisector Theorem): Let $ABC$ be a triangle and point $D$  on $BC$ such that $AD$ is the internal angle bisector of $\angle BAC$. Then,**
$$
\frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{BD}{CD}.
$$
Evoke sin law on $\triangle ABD$ and $\triangle ACD$. Note $\sin{\angle ADB} = \sin{\angle ADC}$ as $\angle ADB = 180^{\circ} - \angle ADC$ (supplementary identity of sin, think of unit circle). Thus, 
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\sin(\angle BAD)}{DB} &= \frac{\sin(\angle ADB)}{AB} \rightarrow \frac{\sin(\angle BAD)}{\sin(\angle ADB)} = \frac{DB}{AB},\\ 
\frac{\sin(\angle CAD)}{DC} &= \frac{\sin(\angle ADC)}{AC} \rightarrow \frac{\sin(\angle CAD)}{\sin(\angle ADC)} = \frac{DC}{AC},\\ 
\angle{BAD} &= \angle CAD, \sin(\angle ADB) = \sin(\angle ADC), \\ 
\frac{DB}{AB} &= \frac{DC}{AC} \rightarrow \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{DB}{DC}.
\end{align}
$$
### 3.2 Ceva's Theorem
A **cevian** is a line joining a vertex of a triangle to it the opposite side through the triangle's interior. 
![[Pasted image 20241121204509.png]]
**Theorem 3.3 (Ceva's Theorem): Let $AX,BY,CZ$ be cevians of a triangle $ABC$. They concur (meet at same point) if and only if**
$$
\frac{BX}{XC} \cdot \frac{CY}{YA} \cdot \frac{AZ}{ZB} = 1. 
$$
The ratios of the bases are essentially a ratio of their triangle areas, since they share an altitude. We proving using a technique where we use same areas to "cancel out terms" from top and bottom, as shown below.
First prove the inverse: If they concur at $P$, then the ratios must multiply to $1$. Note $\triangle BAX$ and $\triangle XAC$ have the same altitude. Same idea for $\triangle BPX$ and $\triangle XPC$. Thus, the ratios areas is the same as the base, so $\frac{BX}{XC} = \frac{[BAX]}{[XAC]} = \frac{[BPX]}{[XPC]}$. We then apply the algebraic trick "if $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, then $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a+c}{b+d}$. We thus have 
$$
\frac{BX}{XC} = \frac{[BAX]-[BPX]}{[XAC]-[XPC]} = \frac{[BAP]}{[ACP]}.
$$
By similar logic, $\frac{CY}{YA} = \frac{[CBP]}{[BAP]}$ and $\frac{AZ}{ZB} = \frac{[ACP]}{[CBP]}$. Thus,
$$
\frac{BX}{XC} \cdot \frac{CY}{YA} \cdot \frac{AZ}{ZB} = \frac{[BAP]}{[ACP]} \cdot \frac{[CBP]}{[BAP]} \cdot \frac{[ACP]}{[CBP]} = 1 
$$
since all areas cancels out. 
To prove the other direction (that three cevians must be concurrent if the equality is satisfied), we use Phantom Points. Let $AX,BY,CZ$ be cevians satisfying the equality. Then, let $BY$ and $CZ$ intersect at $P'$, and let ray $AP'$ meet $BC$ at $X'$. To prove concurrency, we may now only prove $X = X'$. By our proof above, since $BY,CZ,AX'$ is concurrent at $p'$, we know that $\frac{BX'}{X'C} \cdot \frac{CY}{YA} \cdot \frac{AZ}{ZB} = 1$. Since $AX,BY,CZ$ also satisfies the equality, this must mean $\frac{BX}{XC} = \frac{BX'}{X'C}$, so $X = X'$. 

**Theorem 3.4 (Trigonometric Form of Ceva's Theorem): Let $AX,BY,CZ$ be cevians of triangle $ABC$. They concur if and only if**
$$
\frac{\sin(\angle BAX)\sin(\angle CBY)\sin(\angle ACZ)}{\sin(\angle XAC)\sin(\angle YBA)\sin(\angle ZCB)} = 1.
$$
**Problem 3.5: Prove this.**
We apply sin law on $\triangle APB$. We get $\frac{\sin(\angle BAX)}{BP} = \frac{\sin(\angle YBA)}{AP}, \frac{\sin(\angle BAX)}{\sin(\angle YBA)} = \frac{BP}{AP}$. Similarly, we apply sin law on $\triangle APC$ and $\triangle BPC$, getting $\frac{\sin(\angle ACZ)}{\sin(\angle XAC)} = \frac{AP}{PC}$ and $\frac{\sin(\angle CBY)}{\sin(\angle ZCB)} = \frac{PC}{BP}$ respectively. Thus,
$$
\frac{\sin(\angle BAX)\sin(\angle CBY)\sin(\angle ACZ)}{\sin(\angle XAC)\sin(\angle YBA)\sin(\angle ZCB)} = \frac{BP}{AP} \cdot \frac{AC}{PC} \cdot \frac{PC}{BP} = 1.
$$

We can thus prove the existence orthocenter, incenter, and centroid. Let the triangle be $ABC$ with angles $A,B,C$.

For orthocenter, since it's the intersection of the altitudes, each angle is just $90^{\circ}$ minus the other angle (which is one of $A,B,C$). Thus, we use trig form to get
$$
\frac{\sin(90^{\circ}-B)\sin(90^{\circ}-C)\sin(90^{\circ}-A)}{\sin(90^{\circ}-C)\sin(90^{\circ}-A)\sin(90^{\circ}-B)} = 1.
$$

For incenter, since angle bisector produces the same angle, we use trig form to get
$$
\frac{\sin(\frac{1}{2}A)\sin(\frac{1}{2}B)\sin(\frac{1}{2}C)}{\sin(\frac{1}{2}A)\sin(\frac{1}{2}B)\sin(\frac{1}{2}C)} = 1.
$$

For centroid, since the lengths of sides are the same, we use standard form to get 
$$
\frac{1}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{1} = 1. 
$$

**Problem 3.6: Let $AM,BE,CF$ be concurrent cevians of triangle $ABC$. Prove $EF \parallel BC$ if and only if $BM = MC$.**

We first prove if $BM = MC$, then $EF \parallel BC$. By Ceva's Theorem, $\frac{BM}{MC} \cdot \frac{CE}{AE} \cdot \frac{AF}{BF} = \frac{CE}{AE} \cdot \frac{AF}{BF} = 1$. Thus, $\frac{AE}{CE} = \frac{AF}{BF}$. We now have $\frac{AE}{AF} = \frac{CE}{BF} = \frac{AE+CE}{AF+BF} =\frac{AC}{AB}$ by algebra trick. Since $\frac{AE}{AF} = \frac{AC}{AB}$, by SAS similarity $\triangle AFE \sim \triangle ABC$ meaning $\angle AFE = \angle ABC, \angle AEF = \angle ACB$, so it must be that $EF \parallel BC$. 
To prove the inverse, we just work backwards from the above proof since all steps are reversible. By similarity, we first get to the fraction part, then prove by doing algebra trick (but subtracting) that $\frac{AE}{AF} = \frac{CE}{BF}, \frac{AE}{CE} = \frac{AF}{BF}$. Then, we note that $\frac{CE}{AE} \cdot \frac{AF}{BF} = 1$ so by Ceva's Theorem $\frac{BM}{MC} = 1, BM = MC$.
