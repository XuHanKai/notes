## CF Round

**Problem D:** WA D due to wrong idea. I thought it was max power of the prime factors, turns out it is actually the sum of powers of prime factors that dictated levels.

**Problem C2:** Thought it was somewhat disgusting in contest because didn't know how to deal with the upper bound for $y$ when you try for to find $y$ such that $x \oplus y$ is a divisor. This is because xor is very unstable and sometimes the xor would make $y$ big for a small divisor, or vice versa, so you can't just binary search it. I'll look at editorial maybe there is simple way.

We do some PIE and split into cases
Case 1: $x \oplus y$ is divisible by $x$. Let $p = x \oplus y$, then $y = p \oplus x$. We want $y \le m$. 
Since $p \oplus x \le p+x$, and $1 \le y = p+x \le m$ so all $1 \le p \le m-x$ works. Thus, we first add $\lfloor \frac{m-x}{x} \rfloor$. This will include 0 and all other multiples of $x$ other than $x$ itself which we cannot form. However, in some cases (first testcase of sample), this calculation ignores the 0. Thus, we also check if it's possible to have a $y$ such that $p=0$ and we didn't count it. For first condition, it must be that $m \ge x$. For second condition, we didn't count it if $m-x < x$ so we have not reached $x$ yet. Checking for both cases will fix this calculation.
The hard part is if $p > m-x$. 
Instead of thinking about this inequality specifically, we can instead just try to bound our search space in terms of $x$. This way, we may be able to get away with $10^6$ instead of $m$. ==This was the part I didn't think of.==
First, let's think of an upper bound for $y = p \oplus x$. We have $p \oplus x >m$. Note also that $p \oplus x \ge p-x$ since we want the $\ge$ sign for upper bound. Thus, $p \oplus x \ge p-x > m, p \oplus x \ge p > m+x$ has no solutions as $y = p \oplus x$ is out of bounds. Thus, the remaining solutions for $p$ must lie in range $(m-x,m+x]$. We can just easily brute force this within time, then check if $p \oplus x \le m$. 

Case 2: $x \oplus y$ is divisible by $y$. Note if $x \oplus y \le x+y$, so if $y > x, \frac{x \oplus y}{y} \le \frac{x+y}{y} < 2$. Thus, it must be $\frac{x \oplus y}{y} = y, x \oplus y = y, x = 0$ which is impossible. Thus, there are no answers with $y > x$. If $y \le x$, we can just brute force all $y$ in range $[1,x]$.

Case 3: $x \oplus y$ is divisible by both $x$ and $y$. Note this may only happen at $y \le x$. So we just count for all $y$ in range $[1,x]$, if it's also divisible by $x$.

Then, we just add case 1 and case 2, then subtract case 3.

**Problem E:** Didn't attempt in contest

### 3.6 Example Problems

**Example 3.14 (EGMO 2012/7): Let $ABC be acute-angled triangle with circumcenter $T$ and orthocenter $H$. Let $K$ be a point of $T$, on the other side of $BC$ from $A$. Let $L$ be the reflection of $K$ across $AB$, and let $M$ be the reflection of $K$ across $BC$. Let $E$ be the second point of intersection of $T$ with the circumcircle of triangle $BLM$. Show that lines $KH, EM,$ and $BC$ are concurrent.

### 6.1 Definitions
A **complex number** is a number in the form of $z = a+bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i = \sqrt{-1}$. The real part is denoted as $a = Re(z)$. 
**Every** complex number can be expressed in **polar form** as 
$$
z = r(\cos{\theta}+i\sin{\theta}) = re^{i\theta}
$$
for some nonnegative real $r$ (by **Euler's formula** which states $e^{i\theta} = \cos{\theta}+i\sin{\theta}$). Thus, **every** complex number can be plotted on the complex plane as point $(a,b)$.

![[Pasted image 20241123110209.png]]
The **magnitude** of $z = a+bi = re^{i\theta}$, denoted as $|z|$ is equal to 
$$
|z| = r = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}.
$$
The angle in radius $\theta$ is the **argument** of $z$, denoted as $\arg{z}$. We use $\theta \pmod{360^{\circ}}$ as that is the period of $\sin$ and $\cos$ functions, so $30^{\circ} \equiv 390^{\circ} \pmod{360^{\circ}}$ makes no difference in calculations.
The **complex conjugate** of $z$ is the number
$$
\overline{z} = a-bi = re^{-i\theta}.
$$
It is the reflection of $z$ over the real (x) axis. For complex numbers $w$ and $z$, the following properties hold:
$$
\begin{align}
\overline{w+z} &= \overline{w} + \overline{z}, \\
\overline{w-z} &= \overline{w} - \overline{z}, \\
\overline{w\cdot z} &= \overline{w} \cdot \overline{z}, \\
\overline{w\div z} &= \overline{w} \div \overline{z},
\end{align}
$$
so essentially just we can separate conjugates. Thus, we may use these rules to write things like $\overline{\left(\frac{z-a}{b-a}\right)} = \frac{\overline{z} - \overline{a}}{\overline{b} - \overline{a}}$. Also 
$$
|z|^2 = z\overline{z}
$$
since $a^2+b^2 = (a+bi)(a-bi) = a^2 - (-b^2)$. 

For this chapter, We denote a point on the complex plane with an upper case letter (For ex: $A$) that corresponds to the complex number denoted by the corresponding lowercase letter (For ex: $a$). 

### 6.2 Adding and Multiplying Complex Numbers
Complex number can be viewed as vectors $(u,v)$ as the corresponding complex number is $u+vi$. Thus, properties of vector addition (Appendix A.3) can also be applied to complex numbers. Thus, the following are true for complex numbers:
- The midpoint $M$ of $AB$ is $m = \frac{1}{2}(a+b)$.
- Three points $A,B,C$ are collinear if and only if $c = \lambda a + (1-\lambda)b$ for some real number $\lambda$. 
- Centroid $G$ of triangle $ABC$ is $g = \frac{1}{3}(a+b+c)$. 
- Quadrilateral $ABCD$ is a parallelogram if and only if $a+c = b+d$.
Similar to vectors, adding complex numbers corresponds to translation.
Complex numbers can also be multiplied. If $z_1 = r_1e^{i\theta_1}$ and $z_2 = r_2e^{i \theta_2}$, then $z_1z_2 = r_1r_2e^{i(\theta_1 + \theta_2)}$. Thus,
$$
|z_1z_2| = |z_1||z_2|, \arg{z_1}+\arg{z_2}, \textnormal{ for all }z_1,z_2 \in \mathbb{C}.
$$
Note that since we are taking $\arg{z}$ mod $360^{\circ}$, $\arg{z_1z_2} \equiv \arg{z_1}+\arg{z_2} \pmod{360^{\circ}}$. 

**Example 6.1: Multiplying a complex number $z$ by $i$ is equivalent t rotating by $90^{\circ}$ counterclockwise around the origin.**
We have $i = 0 + i\sin{\theta}, \sin{\theta} = 1, \arg{i} = \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} = 90^{\circ}$. Let $z_2 = i = e^{90^{\circ}i}$. We have $z_1z_2 = r_1e^{i(\theta_1+90^{\circ})}$ which is just the original scale factor of $z_1$, but $90^{\circ}$ is added to the angle meaning it rotated $90^{\circ}$ counterclockwise.
Moreover, we can also think about multiplying $i$ as just going from $a+bi$ to $-b,ai$, so from point $(a,b)$ to $(-b,a)$ on the complex plane.
![[Pasted image 20241123220051.png]]

If we want to rotate a point $90^{\circ}$ counterclockwise about some other point $w$, we must translate the original diagram so that $w \rightarrow 0$, apply the $90^{\circ}$ rotation by multiplying $i$, then translation the whole thing back. To apply translation $w\rightarrow 0$, the new coordinates for $z$ is $(a_z-a_w,b_z-b_w)$ which corresponds to $z-w$. Similarily, translating back is $z+w$. Thus, the point after rotating $z$ about $w$ by $90^{\circ}$ counterclockwise is
$$
z \rightarrow (z-w)i + w.
$$
We can then generalize for any complex (non-zero) number as the degree. For any complex number $w$ and non-zero $\alpha$, the mapping
$$
z \rightarrow \alpha(z-w)+w
$$
is a **spiral similarity** that rotates $z$ by $\arg{a}$ and dilates by $|\alpha|$. 



**Lemma 6.2 (Complex Reflection): Let $W$ be the reflection of $Z$ over line $AB$. Then,
$$
w = \frac{(a-b)\overline{z} + \overline{a}b - a\overline{b}}{\overline{a}-\overline{b}}.
$$
