We want to make it so that it is impossible to eliminate X. This is because it will be impossible if its impossible to eliminate X **or** O no matter what we do. WLOG lets make the contruction impossible to eliminate X. Lets define any such sequence as "good."

- Right after the switch, only 3 X in a row can be eliminated
- After 3 in a row eliminated, we can have 4 X in a row eliminated if 2 X
We can only eliminate blocks of 3 or 4 consecutive X at the same time. >5 will cause one side to eliminate 3 before be can eliminate 5 or more all at once.

It is impossible to eliminate 5 X, since it cant be summed by 3a + 4b. Thus, any construction with exactly 5 Xs is "good." To maximize the length, we place at most 2 Os between each X and at the end. Thus, we can place 6 * 2 = 12 Os along with our 5 Xs, so all $N$ from $1$ to $17$ can be "good."
