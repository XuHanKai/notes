To represent a number in base 3, every digit must be $0$, $1$, or $2$.
To construct a *good* number whose base 3 expansion has length $L$, we need to make sure there isn't a leading $0$, and has no consecutive digits that are the same. 

We can only choose $1$ or $2$ as our starting digit, since we cannot have a leading $0$. Moreover, $0$ is not a natural number, so there is no instance where $0$ is the starting digit. For every succeeding digit, we have 2 choices since we cannot choose the current digit( as that would create consecutive digits that are the same). For each of these digits. Thus, there are $2^L$ *good* numbers whose base 3 expansion has length $L$ for every positive integer $L$.

To compare two numbers $a$ and $b$ in its base 3 expansion, we must look at its length, then its digits. If the length of $a$ is smaller than the length of $b$ in its base 3 representation, $a<b$. If their lengths are the same, we look at the first digit where they are different. Whichever number has the bigger digit will be the bigger number.

There are:
$2^1 = 2$ *good* numbers of length 1.
$2^2 = 4$ *good* numbers of length 2.
$2^3 = 8$ *good* numbers of length 3.
$2^4 = 16$ *good* numbers of length 4.
$2^5 = 32$ *good* numbers of length 5.
$2^6 = 64$ *good* numbers of length 6.
$2^7 = 128$ *good* numbers of length 7.
$2^8 = 256$ *good* numbers of length 8.
$2^9 = 512$ *good* numbers of length 9.
$2^{10} = 1024$ *good* numbers of length 10.

There are $1024-1-1 = 1022$ *good* numbers whose length in base 3 is $9$ or below. Then, there are $2048-1-1 = 2046$ *good* numbers whose length in base 3 is $10$ or below. Since $1022 < 2024 < 2046,$ the 2024th smallest *good* number will have a length of $10.$
Moreover, the 2024th *good* number will be the $2024-1022 = 1002$th *good* number whose length is exactly $10$.

We will now construct the 2024th smallest *good* number. 
For the first digit, the first $2^9 = 512$ numbers whose length in base 3 is $10$ starts with "$1$"(as it's the smaller of the two possible choices). Since $1002>512,$ the 2024th *good* number must begin with "$2$". Now, our number lies between the

**WE KNOW THAT 1001 =1111101001. Thus, 1111101001 = 2121202012**
We use the following strategy: we know that every succeeding digit is either 0,1, or 2 but not the current digit. Thus, there are two choices and one is smaller than the other.



Thus, the 2024th smallest *good* number has a base 3 representation of $2121202012_3$ which corresponds to $51575$ in base 10.
