### Part A

P1: $2^r = 16, r = 4$ and $5^2 = 25, s = 2$ so $r+s = 4+2 = \boxed{6}$.

P2: Note $x^2-y^2 = (x+y)(x-y)$. We have $5 \cdot 2 = \frac{(x+y)}{2} \cdot \frac{(x-y)}{2} = \frac{(x+y)(x-y)}{4} = \frac{x^2-y^2}{4}$. Thus, $10 \cdot 4 = x^2-y^2 = \boxed{40}$.

P3: LCM calls for prime factoring, $273 = 3 \cdot 7 \cdot 13$ (Note that $91 = 7 \cdot 13$). This means that the two numbers uses each of $3,7,13$ in its prime factor at most once, and each is used at least once. 
Here, we may have two approaches.
First approach (systematic): Looking at the number with $13$ in it's factor, we can either have $13$ or $13 \cdot 3$ as the number since $13 \cdot 7 = 91 > 60$. If $13$, the other number is $3 \cdot 7 = 21$ (because if $3 \cdot 7 \cdot 13$, it will obviously exceed) but $21 +13 = 34$ so no. If $13 \cdot 3$, we may have $7$ or $7 \cdot 3$. We see that $13 \cdot 3 + 7 \cdot 3 = 39 + 21 = 60$, so we're done.
Second approach (intuition): just look and see that the numbers can't be further apart and be somewhat small. We can see $3 \cdot 7 = 21, 3 \cdot 13 = 39$ so it has to be $21 + 39 = 60$.
The two numbers are $\boxed{21,39}$.

P4: By Pythagorean Theorem, $CD = \sqrt{625^2 - 600^2} = \sqrt{(625+600)(625-600)} = \sqrt{(1225)(25)} = 7 \cdot 25 = 175$ (btw we may also just do this by seeing that $\frac{600}{625} = \frac{24}{25}$ so it's a 7-24-25 right triangle, so $CD = 25 \cdot 7$).
The other information they give is the angle relation. To relate angles to lengths, we use Trig functions. We have $\sin(\angle BAC) = \sin(2 \angle DAC) = 2\sin(\angle DAC)\cos(\angle DAC)$. Since we know all the lengths for $\triangle ADC$, we get $\sin(\angle DAC) = \frac{175}{625} = \frac{7}{25}$ and $\cos(\angle DAC) = \frac{600}{625} = \frac{24}{25}$. Thus, $\sin(\angle BAC) = \sin(2\angle DAC) = 2 \cdot \frac{7}{25} \cdot \frac{24}{25} = \frac{336}{625}$. Moreover, $\sin(\angle BAC) = \frac{opp}{hyp} = \frac{BC}{AC} = \frac{BC}{625}$. Thus, $BC = \boxed{336}$.

P5: Note that any point on a circle forms a right angle  with it's diameter. Thus, $\angle ARB = 90^{\circ}$. We want to try to put as many lengths in terms of $AP = x$ as possible so that we can get some equality and solve. We take advantage of right angles and use Pythagorean Theorem to find length. Since $\angle ARB = 90^{\circ}, \angle ARQ = 90^{\circ}$. Since $\angle APQ = \angle PQB = \angle ARQ = 90^{\circ}$, $PARQ$ is a rectangle. Thus, $AP = QR \rightarrow AP = RB$. $(CD+2) = \sqrt{AB^2-RB^2}= \sqrt{76-x^2}, CD=\sqrt{76-x^2}-2$.  $AD= \sqrt{x^2+(CD+1)^2}, DB = \sqrt{1^2 +(2x)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2+1}$.  Then, $AD = \sqrt{76 - (4x^2+1)} = \sqrt{75-4x^2}$. Thus, 
$$
\begin{align}
x^2+(\sqrt{76-x^2}-1)^2 &= 75-4x^2 \\
x^2+(76-x^2) -2\sqrt{76-x^2}+1 &= 77-2\sqrt{76-x^2} = 75-4x^2 \\
2x^2+1 &= \sqrt{76-x^2} \\
4x^4+4x^2+1 &= 76-x^2 \\
4x^4+5x^2-75 &= 0 \\
x^2 = -5,\frac{15}{4}.
\end{align}
$$
Since the square of a number can't be negative, $x^2 = \frac{15}{4}, x = \pm \frac{\sqrt{15}}{2}$. 
Since $x$ is not negative, $x = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{15}}{2}}$.

### Part B

a) $a^2+a = \frac{4}{9}, a^2+a-\frac{4}{9} = 0, a = -\frac{1}{3}, \frac{4}{3}$. Thus, $a = \boxed{\frac{4}{3}}$.

b) $m^2 + m + \frac{1}{4} + m+\frac{1}{2}$, $m^2 + 2m + \frac{3}{4} = (m+1)^2 - \frac{1}{4}$. Thus, $(m+1)^2- ((m+1)^2 - \frac{1}{4}) = \boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$ for all positive integer $m$.

c) Since they are all positive, $n^2 < c+\sqrt{c} < (n+1)^2$. If $a$ is the smallest such $c$ and $b$ is the largest such $c$. It will be even if and only if $b-a$ is odd since everything in between $a$ and $b$ must also satisfy the inequality. The largest $c$ must have $n \le \sqrt{c} <n+1$. If $\sqrt{c} < n,
