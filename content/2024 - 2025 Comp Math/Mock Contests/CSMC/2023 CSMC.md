### Part B

P2:

c) We may turn this into number theory problem by listing out what we know. First find $\frac{3}{7}$ is bad and shorten the gap. Then, write the equations in algebra to get the corresponding $y$ values to all $x$ values are $f(1),f(2),...,f(99)$. We don't want any of these to be integers.
