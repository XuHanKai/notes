#### Part A
P1: Since $ABCD$ is a parallelogram, $AD$ has the same distance as $BC$. Thus, $C = (7+1, 3+4) = \boxed{(8,7)}$.

P2: Let Sara be given 2, then its fixed that Riley and Wendy's number must be 3 and 4 respectively. Thus, it is forced that Ben's number is 1. However, Ben cannot be 1, which means Sara cannot be given $\boxed{2}$.

P3: We have $101! - 99! = 101 \cdot 100 \cdot 99! - 99! = (101 \cdot 100 - 1) \cdot 99! = (10099) \cdot 99!$. Thus, $\frac{99!}{101! - 99!} = \frac{1}{10099}$ so $n = \boxed{9}$.

P4: Note $\triangle AOB$ is equilateral, so $\triangle OAP$ is a 30-60-90 triangle. Moreover, this means $AF = OA = 4$. Thus, $OA = 4, AP = 4\sqrt{3}$, so area of $\triangle OAP = \boxed{8\sqrt{3}}$.

P5: This can be rephrased as ow many 4 digit numbers such its digits are consecutive and its digit sum is divisible by 3. The consecutives that are divisible by 3 are $\{0,1,2,3\}, \{3,4,5,6\}, \{6,7,8,9\}$. The first set can be rearranged in $3 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 18$ ways, since zero can't be at the front. The other two sets have $4! = 24$ ways. Thus, the total numbers that have these properties is $18+24+24 = \boxed{64}$.

P6: We can split into 6 cases: $x \le y \le 60, x \le 60 \le y, 60 \le x \le y, y \le x \le 60, y \le 60 \le x, 60 \le y \le x$. 
If $x \le y \le 60$, we have $max(60,x) = min(60,y), 60 = y.$ Thus, $x \le y, y = 60$.
If $x \le 60 \le y$, we have $max(60, x) = min(60, y), 60 = 60$. Thus, $x \le 60, y \ge 60$.
If $60 \le x \le y$, we have $max(60, x) = min(x, y), x = x$. Thus, $y \ge x, x \ge 60$.
If $y \le x \le 60$, we have $max(60,y) = min(60,y), 60 = y$. Thus, $y = 60, x = 60$.
If $y \le 60 \le x$, we have $max(60,y) = min(x,y),60 = y$. Thus, $y = 60, x \ge 60$.
If $60 \ge y \ge x$, we have $max(60,y) = min(x,y), y = y$. Thus, $x \ge y, y \ge 60$. 
For the first case, we will cover the $(x,y)=(60,60)$ case. We have $60$ ways for this case.
For the second case, we exclude $y = 60$, so we have $60 \cdot 40 = 2400$ ways.
For the third case, we 'll worry about that later.
For the fourth case, we already accounted for it.
For the fifth case, we'll account for it in the sixth case.
For the sixth case, we can calculate it along with the third case because it's easy to understand. We have $y \ge x, x \ge 60$ or $x \ge y, y \ge 60$, so essentially we choose $x,y$ and they both have to be greater than 60, but we then exclude $(x,y) = (60,60)$. We have $41 \cdot 41 - 1 =  1680$. (==next part I didn't consider this hence WA==) However, note that for the second case, we counted $y \ge 60, x = 60$. Thus, we have to subtract 40 since in $1680$ we counted $y>60, x = 60$. Thus, total is $1680-40=1640$.
Thus in total, we get $60 + 2400 + 1640 = \boxed{4100}$.
==Check original solution as it provides a less messy way to solve, which can be crucial in problems like this where it's easy to make mistakes==
