### Part A

P5: Answer is $f(2,4)$ which denotes the state. We have 
$$
\begin{align}
f(0,1) &= \frac{1}{2} \\
f(0,2) &= \frac{1}{2}f(0,1) = \frac{1}{4} \\
f(0,3) &= \frac{1}{2}f(0,2) = \frac{1}{8} \\
f(0,4) &= \frac{1}{2}f(0,3) = \frac{1}{16} \textnormal{ (note here that game is over)}\\
f(1,0) &= \frac{1}{2} \\
f(1,1) &= \frac{1}{2}f(0,1) + \frac{1}{2}f(1,0) = \frac{1}{2} \\
f(1,2) &= \frac{1}{2}f(0,2) + \frac{1}{2}f(1,1) = \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{8} \\
f(1,3) &= \frac{1}{2}f(0,3) + \frac{1}{2}f(1,2) = \frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16} = \frac{1}{4} \\
f(1,4) &= \frac{1}{2}f(1,3) = \frac{1}{8}. 
\end{align}
$$
Note for $f(1,4$, we don't add $f(0,4)$ since the game is over at that stage, meaning we can't add one more. The total probability is then $f(0,4) + f(1,4) = \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{8} = \boxed{\frac{3}{16}}$.

P6: The numbers$\pmod{5}$ are $\{0,1,2,3,4,0,1,2,3\}$. Since each group of 5 numbers is divisible by $5$, the positions $(1,6), (2,7), (3,8), (4,9)$ have the same residue$\pmod{5}$. Note that position $5$ can be anything. Since $4$ is the only number who doesn't have a pair and every other position requires a pair, it means that $n_5 = 4$. This also means the numbers $(0,5),(1,6), (2,7), (3,8)$ must be paired together. The numbers$\pmod{4}$ are $\{0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,0\}$, so there are 4 distinct pairs that must be together. Moreover, the positions $(1,8), (2,9)$ have the same residue$\pmod{4}$. Note that If we choose a number to be at $n_1$, $n_6$ is fixed as it is the other pair, $n_8$ is fixed by$\pmod{4}$, and thus $n_3$ is fixed. Note finding the sum of numbers suggests we are trying to construct the numbers itself, as the conditions get messy so there is no systematic approach here. We can thus try to let all digits be the first digit.
If $n_1 = 1$, Board is 1_0_46_5_. The mod 7 can't be $0,1,2$, so it must be $3$. Thus, we have 

Essentially just construct everything by hand and add it up.




### Part B


P2:
 x intercept of circle is $P = (12,0)$ and y intercept is $A = (0,16)$. Let $O_1$ be the center of the circle at $(6,8)$

c) Since $\angle AOP = 90^{\circ}, AP$ is the diameter of the circle. Thus, $\angle AXP = 90^{\circ}$ for any point $X$ on the circle. Thus, let $Q = X$, then $R = A = \boxed{(0,16)}$.

d) We may have $\angle SQT = \angle PQS + \angle PQT = 90^{\circ}$. Thus, $ST$ is the diameter. Moreover, this means $P$ bisects $\widehat{ST}$. Thus, $PO_1 \perp ST$. The slope of $PO_1$ is $\frac{9}{6-12} = -\frac{4}{3}.$ The line perpendicular to it has slope $\frac{3}{4}$ and thus the equation satisfies $8 = \frac{3}{4}(6) + c, c = \frac{7}{2}$ so equation is $y = \frac{3}{4}x + \frac{7}{2}$. The intersection between this line and the circle will then be $S,T$. They must satisfy
$$
\begin{align}
100 &= (x-6)^2+(\frac{3}{4}x + \frac{7}{2}-8)^2 \\
&= x^2-12x+36+\frac{9}{16}x^2-\frac{27x}{4}+ \frac{81}{4} \\
&= \frac{25}{16}x^2 - \frac{75}{4}x + \frac{225}{4} \\
0 &= \frac{25}{16}x^2 - \frac{75}{4}x - \frac{175}{4} \\
&= 25x^2 - 300x - 700 \\ 
&= x^2-12x - 28.
\end{align}
$$
Thus, $x = -2,14$ and thus $y =  4, 14$ respectively. Thus, the coordinates $S$ and $T$ are $\boxed{(-2,2), (14,14)}$.
