P1: Money spent is $200 \cdot 2 = 400$. Money gained is $500$. Their profit is $500 - 400 = \boxed{A) \space 100}$.

P2: $x \cdot x \cdot 0.01 = 4, x^2 = 400, x = \boxed{D) \space 20}$.

P3: Let $x$ be amount of money and $y$ be amount of CDs. $\frac{1}{5}x = \frac{1}{3}y, \frac{3}{5}x = y$. So she will use up $\frac{3}{5}$ of her money to buy all the CDs, meaning fraction of money left is $\boxed{C) \space \frac{2}{5}}$.

P4: This means she can only not earn an A in at most 10 quizzes in total. She has already earned less than an A in 8 of her quizzes so far. Thus, the most amount of A's she can afford to lose is $\boxed{B) \space 2}$.

P5: White quarter circles add to to the area of a circle with radius $\frac{1}{2}$. Thus the shaded area of one tile is $1 - \frac{1}{2}^2\pi = 1-\frac{1}{4}\pi$. Total area is thus $80(1 - \frac{1}{4}\pi) = \boxed{A) \space 80 - 20 \pi}$.

P6: Let midpoint of $AB$ be $M$. $MC$ which is the height of $\triangle ABC$ is $\sqrt{7^2-1^2} = \sqrt{48}$. We have $\triangle CMD$ is a right triangle at $\angle M$, so $MD = \sqrt{8^2-MC^2} = \sqrt{64-48} = 4$ which means $BD = MD - MB = 4-1 = \boxed{A) \space 3}$.

P7: This turns into $3|x| + 4|y| = 12$. The area enclosed by $|x|+|y| = 12$ is 4 triangles with both sides $12$. Applying stretch operations we find that the x shrinks by 3 and the y shrinks by 4, so the width of the triangle will be 4 and the height will be 3, so the area is 6. Since there are 4 triangles of the same shape, total area is $6 \cdot 4 = \boxed{D) \space 24}$.

P8: The vertex of the parabola is at $(0, a^2)$. Thus, we want $0+a = a^2$. The only numbers that satisfies $a = a^2$ is $a=0,1$, so the number of values $a$ is just $\boxed{C) \space 2}$.

P9: The median is obviously at 85. The average is $\frac{1}{10} \cdot 70 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot 80 + \frac{1}{5} \cdot 85 + \frac{3}{20} \cdot 90 + \frac{3}{10}\cdot 95 = 7 + 20 + 17 + \frac{27}{2} + \frac{57}{2} = 86$. Thus, the difference is $86-85 = \boxed{B) \space 1)}$.

P10: We try our luck. 2nd term is $2^3+5^3 = 133$. 3rd term is $1+3^3 + 3^3 = 55$. 4th term is $5^3+5^3 = 250$. 5th term is $2^3+5^3 = 133$. Thus we went back tp the 2nd term. Thus this sequence has a period of 3, where after 2005 it will be $133,55,250$. We can thus calculate the 2004th term of this sequence, but beginning with $133$. Since $2004 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$, the 2004th term is $\boxed{E) \space 250}$.

P11: If you draw 20, anything else works. If you draw 10, only 10 or 20 will work. Thus, probability is $\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{7}$.
