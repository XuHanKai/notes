p1: Perfect square has even exponents. 4 can have even or odd exponents since itself is a square but the other ones must be even. Thus answer is $\boxed{C) \space 4^55^46^6}$.

p2: $u_0 = 4, u_1 = 5, u_2 = 2, u_3 = 1, u_4 = 4.$ Thus, it repeats every 4. It goes 5214,5214,... for every 1,2,3,4. 2002 is 2 mod 4, so answer is $\boxed{B) \space 2}$.

p3: Min sum is just make it as "square" as possible. $2002 = 2*7*11*13$. Thus, the best dimensions such that they are most close together is $11*13*14$. Thus, sum is $11+13+14 = \boxed{B) \space 38}$.

p4: Let $\frac{a}{b} = x, a = bx$. Thus, 
$$
x + \frac{bx+10b}{b+10bx} = x+\frac{b(x+10)}{b(1+10x)} = x + \frac{x+10}{1+10x} = 2. 
$$
Thus, this is just simple quadratic.
$$
x+10x^2 x+10 = 2+20x, 10x^2-18x+8 = 0, x = 0.8,1.
$$
Thus, we pick $\boxed{E) \space 0.8}$.
==idk how to do this smart, stuck for a while==

p5: $2002 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13$. So divisors of $2002$ are $1,2,7,11,13,14,22,26,77,91,143,154,172,286,1001,2002$. The numbers in here that are two off of a perfect square is $2,7,14$, so the answer is $\boxed{C) \space three}$.
==smarter way?==

p6: Let $x$ be the previous number of woman, and $t$ be the previous total. We have $1.1t = (1.05)(t-x)+1.2x = 1.05t+0.15x$. Thus, $0.05t = 0.15x$. We currently have $1.1t$ players in the league, and we know that $1.1t = 22 \cdot 0.15x = 3.3x.$ Thus, one-third of the league is now female, so we get $\boxed{A) \space \frac{1}{3}}$. 
==easier way?==

p7: If last number is 1st, we have 9 choices, else we have 10 choices. After each choice, we can have 2,3 or 3,2. Thus, total is $(9+10+10)\cdot 2 = \boxed{D) \space 58}$.
