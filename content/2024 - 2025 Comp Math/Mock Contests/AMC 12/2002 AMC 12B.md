P1: We know total sum is just $9 \cdot (1+11+111+\cdots+111111111) = 9(123456789)$. Since there are 9 numbers in the set, mean is just $123456789$. The number not in this is $\boxed{A) \space 0}$.

P2: This equals $(3x-2)(4x+1 - (4x)) + 1 = (3x-2)(1)+1 = \boxed{D) \space 11}$.

P3: This equals $(n-1)(n-2)$. This is a prime number if its not a root, and one of the expressions is 1. Only positive integer that satisfies is $n=3, (n-1)(n-2) = 2$. Thus, there is only $\boxed{\textnormal{B) one}}$.

P4: This equals $\frac{21+14+6}{42}+\frac{1}{n} = \frac{41}{42}+\frac{1}{n}$. Thus, we can just make $n=42$ for the sum to be 1, which means the false statement is $\boxed{E) \space n>84}$. 

P5: We have $x-2d,x-d,x,x+d,x+2d = 5x = 180(5-2) = 540$. Thus, $x = \boxed{D) \space 108}$.

P6: We have $x^2+ax+b = (x-a)(x-b) = x^2 -(a+b)x + ab$. Thus, $-a-b = a, -b = 2a$ and $ab = b, a = 1$. This means $b = -2$ so the pair $(a,b)$ is $\boxed{C) \space (1,-2)}$.

P7: We have $8(a-1+a+a+1) = 8\cdot 3a = (a-1)(a+1)a = (a^2-1)(a)$. Thus, $24 = a^2 - 1$ and $a = 5$. Thus, the sequence is $4,5,6$ which means the sum of their squares is $16 + 25 + 36 = \boxed{B) \space 77}$.

P8: It occurs 5 times in a month of 31 days if it appears in the last 3 days. If the last 3 days of July are $c-2,c-1,c$, the last 3 days of august are $c+1,c+2,c+3$. No matter where Monday is in $c-2,c-1,c$, Monday+3 must appear in $c+1,c+2,c+3$. Thus Monday+3 is $\boxed{D) \space Thursday}$.

P9: Let $x = b$. Then, the sequences are $x-d,x,x+d,x+2d$ and $x/r,x,xr$ for some $d$ and $r$. We have $x-d = x/r, x+2d = xr$. 
meh tbh idk how to proceed,
Like tbh imma just guess that $a,b,c,d = 1,2,3,4$ and it works, so $\frac{a}{d} = \boxed{C) \space \frac{1}{4}}$.
==how to solve rigorously?==

P10: It's all numbers in the form of $3x+1, 0 \le x \le 6$. Thus every sum is in the form of $3(x_1+x_2+x_3)+3 = 3(x_1+x_2+x_3+1)$.
We can form all numbers from 3 to 15 by using 3 distinct elements from $\{0,1,...,6\}$. Thus total distinct sum we can form is $\boxed{A) \space 13}$.
