P1: To complete on third of the day's job, the machine worked for 2 hours 40 minutes. Thus, it will complete the job at $11:10 + 5:20 = \boxed{\textnormal{D) 4:30 PM}}$.

P2: $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{2}{3} = \frac{7}{6}, \frac{1}{\frac{7}{6}} = \boxed{A) \space \frac{6}{7}}$.

P3: Reword the question to "how many oranges are $\frac{1}{4}$ of 10 bananas". We have $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 10b = 8o \cdot \frac{3}{2} \cdot {1}{4} = \boxed{C) \space 3}$.

P4: Cancelling, the product is $\frac{2008}{4} = \boxed{B) \space 502}$.

P5: This is equal to $\frac{4x-x}{6} = \frac{x}{2}$. Clearly, $\boxed{\textnormal{B) It is even, but not necessarily a multiple of 3}}$.

P6: Let this price be $x$. We have $0.85x-90 + 15 = 0.75x, 0.1x = 75, x = \boxed{A) \space 750}$,

P7: Steve can reach the shore in $\frac{1}{4}$ hours = $15$ minutes. Let $x$ be the rate at which LeRoy bails water. We have $15(10-x) \le 30$ which has max at $10-x = 2$. Thus, $x = \boxed{D) \space 8}$.

P8: If surface area is twice, area of one face is twice. Thus, side length of this cube is $\sqrt{2}$ meaning the volume is $\boxed{C) \space 2\sqrt{2}}$.
