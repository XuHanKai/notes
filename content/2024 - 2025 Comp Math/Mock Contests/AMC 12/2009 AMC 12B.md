P1: We can construct a whole number with 2 muffins, 4 bagels, or 1 muffin + 2 bagels. We can use 1 muffin + 2 bagels and 2 muffins for a total of 5 days, since $0.5 + 2 \cdot 0.75 + 2 \cdot 0.5 = 3.00$. Thus, number of bagels she bought is $\boxed{B) \space 2}$.

P2: This means $3$ cans can paint $5$ rooms. Thus, number of cans needed for $25$ rooms is $3 \cdot \frac{25}{5} = \boxed{C) \space 15}$.

P3: Twenty percent less than 60 is $60 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = 48$. Thus, the desired number $x$ must satisfies $\frac{4}{3}x = 48, x = \boxed{D) \space 36}$.

P4: The side length of the triangle is $\frac{25-15}{2} = 5$. Thus, the flower bed has total area of $2 \cdot \frac{5^2}{2} = 25$. The total area of yard is $25 \cdot 5 = 125$. Thus, the ratio is $\frac{25}{125} = \boxed{C) \space \frac{1}{5}}$.

P5: Since $128 = 2^7$, we can deduct that the two older brothers are probably $\sqrt{2^6} = 8$ and Kiana is $2$. Anything greater would probably make Kiana older than her older brothers. Thus, sum is $2+8+8 = \boxed{D) \space 18}$.

P6: If we bracket 2, we can obtain $(3+4)\cdot 5 = 35$ or $(3+ 4\cdot 5) = 23$. Thus, the value is $70$ and $46$. If we bracket $(2 \cdot 3)$, we either have $((2\cdot 3) +4) \cdot 5 = 50$ or $(2\cdot 3) + (4\cdot 5) = 26$. Then, if we do $(2 \cdot 3 + 4)$ or $(2 \cdot 3 + 4 \cdot 5)$ we arrive at same value that we already counted. Thus, the distinct values is $\boxed{C) \space 4}$.

P7: Let $a$ be the January price. We have $a \cdot \frac{6}{5} \cdot \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{4} \cdot \frac{100-x}{100} = a$. Thus, $\frac{6}{5} \cdot \frac{100-x}{100} = 1, \frac{5}{6} = \frac{100-x}{100}, x = \frac{500}{6} = 100-x \approx 83$. Thus, $x \approx \boxed{B) \space 17}$.

P8: Let bucked weight be $x$ and full water weight be $y$. We have $x + \frac{2}{3}y = a$ and $x + \frac{1}{2}y = b$. We want $x+y$. Experimenting, we find $3x+2y = 3a$ and $2x+y = 2b$. Thus, $x+y = (3x+2y)-(2x+y)=\boxed{E) \space 3a-2b}$.

P9: The base of the triangle has length $3\sqrt{2}$. All we need is the height which is the shortest distance between $A$ and line $x+y=7$. By [[Analytic Geometry]], this turns out to be $d = \frac{|3+0-7|}{\sqrt{1+1}} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{2}}$. Thus, area is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 3\sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{4}{\sqrt{2}} = \boxed{A) \space 6}$.

P10: A 12 hour clock goes from 01:00 to 12:59. Thus, total number of time is $12 \cdot 60 = 720$. We then calculate how many time doesn't have any 1s in it. The first digit must be 0, the second digit can be 1-9 excluding 1, so $8$ choices. The third and forth digit cannot contain 1. From 0 to 59, there are $10 + 5 = 15$ numbers that contain at least one 1. Thus, there remains $60-15 = 45$ good numbers. The total number of good times is thus $8 \cdot 45 = 360$ which means the fraction is $\frac{360}{720} = \boxed{A) \space \frac{1}{2}}$.
