P1: $x = 20, y = 10, x-y = 20-10 = \boxed{D) \space 10}$.

P2: $2x+4 = 0 = bx-8, 2x+12 = bx$. The solution is $x = -2$. Thus, $-4+12 = -2b, b = \boxed{B) \space -4}$.

P3: Let the width be $a$. We have $a^2 + (2a)^2 = x^2, 5a^2 = x^2.$ The area is $2a^2 = \boxed{B) \space \frac{2}{5}x^2}$.

P4: If they purchase separately, Dave saves 100 and Doug saves 100. If they purchase together, they need 15 windows in total so they save 300. Thus, $300 - 200 = \boxed{A) \space 100}$.

P5: $\frac{2}{5}30 + \frac{3}{5}20 = \boxed{B) \space 24}$.

P6: Let $t$ are $r$ be Mikes time and rate respectively. We have $tr + 2t \cdot \frac{4}{5}r = 13, tr(1 + 2 \cdot \frac{4}{5}) = 13$. Thus, $tr = \frac{13}{\frac{13}{5}} = \boxed{B) \space 5}$.

P7: $EFGH$ is a square so $BE = CF = DG = AH = 1$. We have $BE^2 + EC^2 = BC^2, 1 + EC^2 = 50, EC = 7$. Thus, $EF = EC-FC = 7-1 = 6$ which means the area is $6^2 = \boxed{C) \space 36}$.

P8: $2005 = 5 \cdot 401$. The problem asks for a number multiplied by the sum of its digits is $2005$, and $401$ works. Thus, $A = \boxed{D) \space 4}$.

P9: One solution occurs when the discriminant is 0. We have $(a+8)^2 - 4(4)(9) = 0, a^2+16a+8^2 - 8(18) = 0, a^2+16-80 = 0$. By [[Vietas Formula]], the sum of roots is $\boxed{A) \space -16}$.

P10: There are 8 corners, so 8 has 3 colored faces. There are 12 edges, so $12(n-2)$ have 2 faces colored. There are 6 sides, so $6(n-2)^2$ have 1 face colored. Thus the total number of colored faces in terms of $n$ is $24 + 24(n-2)+6(n-2)^2 = 24 + 24n - 48 + 6n^2+24-24n = 6n^2$. There are $6n^3$ faces in total, so $6n^2 = \frac{1}{4}6n^3, 4 \cdot 6n^2 = 6n^3$. Thus, $n = \boxed{B) \space 4}$.

P11: After picking the first and last digit, the middle digit is fixed. Moreover, the sum of first and last must be even. Thus, we must have odd-odd or even-even pairing. Moreover, first number can't be 0. So there are $5\cdot 5 = 25$ ways for odd pairings and $4 \cdot 5 = 20$ ways for even pairing for a total of $25+20 = \boxed{E) \space 45}$.

P12: This is the same as $A = (0,0)$ and $B = (99,999)$. The slope of this is $\frac{999}{99} = \frac{111}{11}$. Thus, each time x increases by 1, y increases by 11. Thus, the number of integer coordinates is $99 \div 11 = \boxed{E) \space 9}$.

P13: Let the middle term be $a$, then $a-2d + a-d + a + a+d + a+2d = 5a = 2(3+5+6+7+9) = 60, a = \boxed{D) \space 12}$.

P14: There are 21 dots in total. Removing a dot can turn even to odd or odd to even. 12/21 of the dots are even, 9/21 of the dots are odd. If we choose an even dot, it gets turned into odd. Thus, there is 4/6 chance of odd being picked. Else if we choose odd dot, we turn into even so there is 2/6 chance of odd being picked. Thus, total probability is $\frac{12}{21} \cdot \frac{4}{6} + \frac{9}{21} \cdot \frac{2}{6} = \boxed{D) \space \frac{11}{21}}$.
