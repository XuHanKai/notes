p1: add 3 to each means add 6 to total. Doubling each means doubling total. Thus we have 2(S+6) = $\boxed{E) \space 2S+12}$.

p2: Let $N = 10a+b$. We thus have $(ab) + (a + b) = 10a + b, a(b+1)=10a$. Thus, $b = \boxed{E) \space 9}$.

p3: Let $x$ be the amount over $28000. We have $(28000+x)(p+0.0025) = 28000p + x(p+0.02)$. Thus, $x(p+0.02) = xp + 0.02x = xp+0.0025x+28000*0.0025$, so $0.02x = 0.0025x + 70$.
We then get $0.0175x = 70, x = \frac{70}{0.0175}=4000$ which means income is $\boxed{B) \space \$32000}$.  

p4: Let the 3 numbers be a,5,c. By info 1 we have $\frac{a+5+c}{3} = a+10, a+5+c = 3a+30, c = 2a+25$. By info 2 we have $\frac{a+5+c}{3} = c-15, a+5+c = 3c-45,a = 2c-50$. Thus, we get $a = 2(2a+25)-50, a = 4a, 0 = a$ and therefore $c = 0+25 = 25$. The sum is therefore $\boxed{D) \space 30}$.

p5: The even numbers can be represented as $2X$ for every odd $X$. We have for each 1-5000 we multiply by 2 so the product of it is $\prod_1^{5000} 2 \cdot X = 2^{5000} \cdot 5000!$. Then the odd product is total / even product = $\boxed{D) \space \frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}}$.

p6: We list it out and find that G,H,I,J = 3,5,7,9 and D,E,F = 2,4,6. Doing this, we get A,B,C = 1,0,8. Since A is largest, $A = \boxed{E) \space 8}$.

p7: Let $x$ cnt of be full price, and $y$ be the full price. We have $xy + \frac{140-x}{2}y = 2001$, $\frac{xy}{2} + 70y = 2001$, $(x+140)y=4002$. We then can just get suitable answers for x and y. Note that x <= 140. We have $402 = 2\cdot 3 \cdot 23 \cdot 29$, so it can be that $x+140 =2 \cdot 3 \cdot 29 = 174, x = 34.$ Thus, $y = 23$ and $xy = \boxed{A) \space \$ 782}$.

p8: Slant height is 10, so height < 10. Circumference of base is $\frac{252}{360} \cdot 20 \pi = 14 \pi$. This is also $2\pi r$ of the base, so we have $14 \pi = 2 \pi r, r = 7$. $\boxed{C) \space \textnormal{ Slanted height = 10 and r = 7}}$

p9: $f(500) = \frac{f(100)}{5}, 5f(500) = f(100) = 15.$ Moreover, $f(600) = \frac{f(100)}{6}, 6f(600) = f(100) = 15$. Thus, $f(600)  = 15/6 = \boxed{C) \space \frac{5}{2}}$.

p10: Divide into 3x3, each square is same so we just take percentage of one small square. If then divide this square into a 3x3, we see pentagons take up 5/9 of the square. 5/9 in percentage is $\boxed{E) \space 56}$.

p11: Fix the last chip as white, there is then 4 choose 1 ways to choose the position of the other white chip. We calculate numerator and denominator separately for speed. There are 3, then 2, then 1 red to choose. The time we pick white there are 2. For denominator there are 5, then 4, then 3, then 2 total choices. Thus, the ways is
$$
4 \cdot \left(\frac{3\cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 2}{5\cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2}\right) = \boxed{B) \space \frac{2}{5}}.
$$

p12: The number of integers multiple of 3 or 4 is $\lfloor \frac{2001}{3} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{2001}{4}\rfloor - \lfloor \frac{2001}{12} \rfloor = 667 + 500 - 166 = 1001$.
The number of integers who is a multiple of 5 AND (3 or 4) is $\lfloor \frac{2001}{15} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{2001}{20}\rfloor - \lfloor \frac{2001}{60} \rfloor = 133 + 100 - 33 = 200$. Thus, $1001 - 200 = \boxed{B) \space 801}$.

p13: The quadratic is in the form of $a(x-h)^2 + k = ax^2-a(2xh)+ah^2+k$. After flipping, we have $-a(x-h)^2 + k = -ax^2 +a2xh -ah^2+k$. The sum of all the coefficients is then $ax^2-ax^2-a(2xh)+a2xh+ah^2-ah^2+2k = \boxed{E) \space 2k}$.

p14: There are 2 cases: either the third vertex is also in the set or it isn't. 
If it's also in the set, that means the two vertices have exactly two vertices in between them in the set( so along with the third vertex we form equilateral triangle where are 3 vertices are in the set). There are in total 3 such triangle. Each triangle there are 3 ways to pick 2 vertices, so a total of 3 x 3 = 9 ways. So 9 ways to produce 3 triangles
If two aren't in the set, it means its not one of the 9 ways. Then, it can always for a distinct triangle. Thus each way produces 1 triangle. There are in total 9 choose 2 ways. Subtract the 9(first case) we get 36-9 = 27. Thus, total number of distinct triangles is $27+3 = \boxed{A) \space 30}$.

p15: **regular tetrahedron = 4 sided equilateral triangle**. We make the two triangles in 2d for better visualization. Note that the plane that will contain this path is a diamond shape made of two equilateral triangles. To travel from midpoint of one to the opposite midpoint is just a straight line where the length is the same as the side length. Thus, the answer is just $\boxed{B) \space 1}$.

p16: Restate the problem: there are 8 colors and 2 indistinguishable balls of each color. This is just $16!$, then divide by $(2!)^8$ for each overcount = $\boxed{D) \space \frac{16!}{2^8}}$.

p17: I would like to guess that it will only be obtuse if P is within the semi circle of which AB is the diameter. Otherwise its acute. Thus, the answer is just semicircle area/total area since I don't think the semi circle will go out of bounds( radius = sqrt(5) < 3). The area of the semi circle is $5 \pi/2 = 2.5\pi$. The area of the pentagon is $4(2\pi+1) - 2*4/2 = 8\pi$. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{C) \space \frac{5}{16}}$.

p18: $\sqrt{4*1*x} + \sqrt{4*4*x} = (2+4)\sqrt{x} = 4, \sqrt{x} = \frac{4}{6}, x = \boxed{D) \space \frac{4}{9}}.$

p19: By Vietas formula, $\frac{-a}{3} = -c = a+b+c+1.$ Moreover, $c=2$. Thus, $a = 6$ and $b = \boxed{A) \space -11}$. 

p20: The midpoint of $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ is just $((a+c)/2,(b+d)/2)$. Draw it out and the other two points must be (6,3) for midpoint of CD and (5,6) for midpoint of AD. Thus, we find that (7,3) satisfies both condition so its $7+3 = \boxed{C) \space 10}$.
