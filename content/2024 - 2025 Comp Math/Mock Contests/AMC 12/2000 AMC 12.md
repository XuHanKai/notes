P1: Largest sum whose product is $N$ is solved using the idea that the numbers are as far away as possible. Thus, we have I = 1, MO = 2001 where M and O > 1. Note 2001 is divisible by 3 which is small so I = 1, M = 3, O = 2001/3 = 667. The largest sum is thus 671 which is $\boxed{E}$.

P2: $2000 \cdot 2000^{2000} = 2000^{2001} = \boxed{A}$.

P3: After each day, Jenny is left with 0.8 of her original. Let $x$ = original, then $x \cdot (4/5)^2 = 32$. Thus, $x = \frac{32}{16/25} =50 = \boxed{B}.$ 

P4: Idk this theory so I brute force and list everything - 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,4,13,17,0,7,7,14,...
We see 6 doesn't appear and everything else does, so it must be $6 = \boxed{C}$.

P5: $x-2 = p$ or $x-2 = -p$. So it's clearly the latter. So we have $x-p=-2p+2 = \boxed{C}$. 

P6: Primes are both odd, so product is odd and sum is even, so the product-sum = odd, it's C or E. Note (a-1)(b-1) = (ab-a-b)+1. Lets add 1 to each to get (a-1)(b-1)= 120 or 232. We see 12 and 10 for a-1 and b-1, so 13 and 11 for a and b. This works, so it's $\boxed{C}$.

P7: $729 = 3^6$, so the numbers are $3,3^2,3^3,3^6$ so 4 integers = $\boxed{E}$.

P8: Look at the inner squares and outer square to make a 2 big squares. We see that For figure $x$, the number of squares is $x^2+(x+1)^2$, so figure 100 has $100^2 + (101)^2 = 20201$ squares, so $\boxed{C}$.

P9: 71 + 76 + 80 + 82 + 91 = 400, so 400+x is divisible by 6. Note $400 \equiv 4 \pmod 6$ 

P10: Reflection over xy gets (1,2,-3). Rotate 180 about x axis is (1,-2,3). Translating 5 y direction is (1,3,3) = $\boxed{E}$.

P11: Expand and substitute: $\frac{a^2 + b^2}{ab} - ab = \frac{(a-b)^2+2(a-b)}{a-b} - (a-b) = (a-b)+2-(a-b) = 2 = \boxed{E}$.

P12: no idea

P13: Guessing: We cant make sure what the amount of milk or coffee is by the info given, so we assume: $\frac{x}{4}+\frac{y}{6} = 8, 3x + 2y = 96$. We can "assume" $x = 16, y = 24$. Thus, the total is $40$. Each takes 8 so $40/8 = 5$ people so $\boxed{C}$. 

P14: mode is forced = 2. Median is either 2,3 or 4 depending on what we pick. If its 2 or 3, the number we pick is the median so we must pick 2/3. If its 2, its impossible since 2,2,mean=2 and mean is not 2. If its 3 then 2,3,mean = 4. 2+2+2+4+5+10 = 25, 25+3=28/7 = 4, so it works. Thus, we can pick 3 and it will satisfy. If we pick smth else then median = 4, so 2,4,mean. So the mean must be 6( since it can't be 0 or 3). Thus, we must pick x =17 so 25+17 = 42, 42/7 = 6, which also satisfies. Thus the sum is just 3+17=20 so $\boxed{E}$

P15: $f(3z) = f(9z/3) = (9z)^2+9z+1 = 81z^2 + 9z + 1 = 7$.  By vieta, sum of $z$ is $-\frac{1}{9}$ so $\boxed{B}$.

P16: We can model the number of each cell of the 2 numbering systems by equation usign its coordinates. We thus have $13(y-1)+x = 17(x-1)+y$. We get $13y-13+x = 17x-17+y, 12y-16x=-4, 16x-12y = 4, 4x-3y=1.$ We see that x = 1, 4x = 4 satisfies this( there is a y such that the equation works). Note that this is 1 mod 3. Then, the mod cycles every 3 so the next 3rd x it will also work, so it will only work for x = 1,4,7,10,13. The corresponding y values are 1,5,9,13,17. Plugging in the equations, we thus get $1, 56,111,166,221$. The sum of this is 555, so $\boxed{D}$.

P17: trig bash sus


P18: N+1th year is leap year. So we calculate normally. There is a 565 day difference. -565 mod 7 = -5 mod 7 = 2 mod 7. Thus, its Thursday = $\boxed{A}$.

P19: Let $BE = x$. By angle bisector theorem, $\frac{13}{x} = \frac{15}{14-x}, x = \frac{13}{2}$. Thus, $ED = 0.5$. Then, I predict that the height is 12 since it can be split into a 5-12-13 and a 9-12-15 right triangles. Thus, the area is $0.5 \cdot 12 / 2 = 3$ which is $\boxed{C}$.

P20: (think ive done this before somewhere) We see what we can do if we multiply everything since they look similar. We get
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{28}{3} &=  \left(x + \frac{1}{y}\right)\left(y + \frac{1}{z}\right)\left(z + \frac{1}{x}\right)
\\ & = xyz+\left(x+y+z+\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}+\frac{1}{z}\right) + \frac{1}{xyz}
\\ &= xyz + \frac{1}{xyz} + (4+1+\frac{7}{3}). 
\end{align}
$$
Thus, let $a = xyz$ and we get $\frac{6}{3} = a + \frac{1}{a}$. Multiply $a$ both sides we get $a^2-2a+1=0$. Solving this yields $a= 1$, so $\boxed{B}$.
