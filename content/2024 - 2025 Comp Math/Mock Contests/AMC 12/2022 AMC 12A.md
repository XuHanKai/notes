P1: $3 + \frac{1}{3 + \frac{1}{\frac{10}{3}}} = 3 + \frac{1}{\frac{33}{10}} = \boxed{D) \space \frac{109}{33}}$.

P2: $(6c) + (c+40) + c= 8c + 40 = 96, c = 7, a = 42, b = 47, b-a = \boxed{E) \space 5}$.

P3: ==Since it's a square, we can use it's area to get side length==. The area is $6 + 8 + 30 + 14 + 6 = 64$, thus, side length is $8$ and perimeter is $4 \cdot 9 = 32$. $1+6+2+4+5+6+2+7+2+3=38, 38-32 = 6$. Thus, the shaded rectangle has half its perimeter = 6. The only such rectangle is $\boxed{E) \space E}$.

P4: $18 = 2 \cdot 3^2, 180 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5$. Thus, $n = 3^x \cdot 20, x \le 2$. The only number that satisfies is $n = 60, 6+0 = \boxed{B) \space 6}$.

P5: Absolute value means it's the same on all 4 quadrants. We have $x+y \le 20$. This is just isosceles right triangle with side length $20$, so total number of points is $1+2+...+21 = \frac{21\cdot 22}{2} = 231, 4 \cdot 231 = \boxed{E) \space 924}$.

P6: $\frac{20+X}{6} = a, a \ge \lceil \frac{20}{6} \rceil = 4$. If $5, X=10$. If $7, X= 22$. $10 + 22 = \boxed{C) \space 32}$.

P7: Assign $A,B,C,D,E$ from left to right, top to bottom. $A,C,D$ are different so $5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 60$. $B$ different from $A,D$ so 3 choices. $E$ different from $B,D$ so 3 choices. Total is $60 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = \boxed{D) \space 540}$.

P8: Same as $10^{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{27}+ \cdots}$. $\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{27} + \cdots = \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{1- \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{2}, 10^{\frac{1}{2}} = \boxed{A) \space \sqrt{10}}$.

P9: Let truth, alt (tells truth first and tells false first), lie be $a,tb,fb,c$ so $a+tb+fb+c = 31$. $22 = a+fb + c, 15 = fb+c$. Thus, $a = 22-15 = \boxed{A) \space 7}$.

P10: $8,9,10,11,12,13,14$ must be the bigger numbers. $7$ must pair with $14$. $6$ has 2 choices, $5$ has 3 choices, $3$ has 4 choices, then remaining 3 can get $3!$ choices. Thus, $1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 3! = \boxed{E) \space 144}$.

P11: Twice the distance of $\log_6{10} - \log_6{6} = \log_6{\frac{10}{6}}$ is $\log_6{\frac{100}{36}} = \log_6{\frac{25}{9}}$. Either $\log_6{\frac{x}{9}} = 2\log_6{\frac{5}{3}}, \frac{x}{9} = \frac{25}{9}, x = 25$ or  $\log_6{\frac{9}{x}} = 2\log_6{\frac{5}{3}}, \frac{9}{x} = \frac{25}{9}, \frac{81}{25}=x$. $25 \cdot \frac{81}{25} = \boxed{E) \space 81}$.

P12: From [[3D Polygons]], tetrahedron is 4 sided equilateral triangles pyramid. Let $C$ be top, $C$ meets plane $ABD$ in the center (which is also the median). Let $E$ be center of $\triangle ABD$ and $M$ be foot of median from $D$ to $AB$. We have $DM = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, EM = \frac{1}{3}\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}$. Moreover, $CE = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ by $\triangle AEC$. Thus, $\cos(\angle CMD) = \frac{EM}{CE} = \boxed{B) \space \frac{1}{3}}$.

P13: $z_1$ is on line from $(3,0)$ and $(0,4)$. $z_2$ is the area bounded by the unit circle. The sum is just for each point on $z_1$, make that as the center of a unit circle. We thus have a ice-rink like shape with two semi circles radius 1 at both ends and rectangle with dimensions $2$ and $\sqrt{3^2+4^2}=5$. Thus, area is $2 \cot 5 + 1^2 \pi \approx \boxed{A) \space 13}$.

P14: We want to put these expressions into common number so we only have one variable. We have $\log{5} = \log{10} - \log{2} = 1-\log{2}$, $\log{20} = \log{2} + \log{10} = \log{2}+1$, $\log{8}\log{0.25} =  \log{8}(\log{2}-\log{8} = 3\log{2}(-2\log{2}) = -6\log^2{2}$.
Thus, $(1-\log{2})^3 + (1+\log{2})^3 -6\log^2{2} = 2(1)+2(3\log^2{2})-6\log^2{2} = \boxed{C) \space 2}$.

P15: $(a+2)(b+2)(c+2) = abc + 2(ab+ac+bc) + 4(a+b+c) +8$. By [[Vietas Formula]], $a+b+c = \frac{39}{10}, ab+ac+bc = \frac{29}{10}, abc = \frac{6}{10}$. Thus, $\frac{6}{10} + 2(\frac{29}{10}) + 4(\frac{39}{10}) + 8= \frac{300}{10} = \boxed{D) \space 30}$.

P16: $t_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. Note $n$ and $n+1$ are always coprime for $n \ge 2$. If it's even, $\frac{n}{2}$ is perfect square and $n+1$ is perfect square. We can then do some brute forcing, though this is not rigorous. 
==oof cant see this stuff :(==
We have $\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = k^2$ for some $k$, so $n^2+n = 2k^2$. We want to convert this into a [[Pell's Equation]] from [[Diophantine Equations]] since we have two squares. We make important observation that $4n^2 + 4n + 1 = (2n+1)^2$ so $4n^2+4n+1-8k^2 = (2n+1)^2-8k^2 = 1$. The first solution is $x_1 = 2n+1 = 3, y+1 = k = 1$. Thus, the 4th solution is $(x_n+y_n\sqrt{8} = (3+\sqrt{8})^ 4= (9+8+6\sqrt{8})^2 = 17^2+6^2 \cdot 8 + 2(17)(6\sqrt{8}) = 577 +204 \sqrt{8}$ . Thus, $2n+1 = 577, n = 288, 2+8+8 = \boxed{D) \space 18}$.
