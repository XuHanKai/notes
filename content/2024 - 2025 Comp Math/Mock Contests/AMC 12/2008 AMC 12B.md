P1: Configurations differ by the amount of threes in their sum, since they all must have 5 numbers. Thus, it's just 0 to 5 threes so $\boxed{E) \space 6}$.

P2: The sums are $1+10+17+22 =50$ and $4 + 9 + 16 + 25=54$. Thus, the difference is $54 - 50 = \boxed{B) \space 4}$.

P3: We want to maximize one player. The max amount must be $700000 - 15000 \cdot 20 = \boxed{C) \space 400,000}$.

P4: We have $\angle CPD = 180^{\circ} - 75^{\circ} = 105^{\circ}$. Thus, the ratio is $\frac{105}{360} = \boxed{D) \space \frac{7}{24}}$.

P5: The bouquets differ by the amount of threes in their sum. We want $3x + 2y = 50$. Therefore, the different non-negative integers $x$ possible such that $y$ is also a non-negative integer. Since $x$ must be even, the values are $0,2,4,6,8,...,16$ (because if we pick 17 that will exceed 50). Thus, the different number of configurations is $\boxed{C) \space 9}$.

P6: Total number of steps taken is $100000 \cdot 44 +50000 = 4450000$. Thus, number of miles is $4450000 \div 1800 \approx \boxed{A) \space 2500}$.

P7: Let $a = x-y$. Note that $a^2 = (-a)^2$ for any $a$. Thus, $(x-y)^2 = (y-x)^2$ which means $a\$a = (a-a)^2 = \boxed{A) \space 0}$.

P8: We can model using an example. Let $AD = 5 \cdot 10 = 50$. Then, $AB = 40, AC = 45, BC = 5$. Thus, $\frac{BC}{AD} = \frac{5}{50} = \boxed{C) \space \frac{1}{10}}$.

P9: Let $M$ be the midpoint of chord $AB$. We have $AM = BM = 3$. Since $AO = 5$, $\triangle AMO$ is a 3-4-5 triangle. Thus, $OM = 4$ which means $MC = 5-4 = 1$. Then, $AC = \sqrt{MC^2+AM^2} = \boxed{A) \space \sqrt{10}}$.

P10: Let their brick rate per hour be $a$ and $b$ respectively. Let $s$ be total bricks. We then have $9a = 10b = s$ which means $b = \frac{9}{10}a$. Moreover, $s = 5(a+b-10) = \frac{19}{2}a-50$. Thus, $9a = 9.5a-50, a= 100$ which means $s = \boxed{B) \space 900}$.

P11: By [[3D Polygons]], total volume of cone is $\frac{8000}{3}\pi r^2$ where $r$ is the base radius. Thus, one eighth of volume is $1000 \cdot \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2$. Let $h$ be the height. Then, the radius $r_1$ at that height can be modelled as $\frac{h}{r_1} = \frac{8000}{r}, \frac{hr}{8000} = r_1$. We thus have $1000 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 = \frac{h}{3}\pi (\frac{hr}{8000})^2 = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 \cdot (\frac{h^3}{64000000})$. Thus, $\frac{h^3}{64000000}=1000, h = \boxed{A) \space 4000}$. 

P12: We want the first $n$ terms to sum to $n^2$. We go through first few numbers and see that it looks like the sequence is $1,3,5,7,9,...$, so just the odd numbers. We try to prove this. For integer $n$, the sum of this sequence is $n \cdot \frac{1+(2n-1)}{2} = n^2$. Thus, this works which means the 2008th term is $\boxed{B) \space 4015}$. 

P13: The total area outside $\triangle ABE$ is $1 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}$. Dividing $CD$ into three sections, the two sections outside form two congruent trapezoids. Let the point on $\frac{2}{3}$ of $BC$ be $F$ and the corresponding point on $BE$ be $G$ so that the trapezoid is $BCFG$. We have $FG = 1 - \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 1-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$. Thus, area of $BCFG$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot (1+(1-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}) )\cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{6-\sqrt{3}}{18}$. Thus,  the desired area is $1-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} - 2 \cdot \frac{6-\sqrt{3}}{18} = 1 - (\frac{9\sqrt{3}}{36} + \frac{24-4\sqrt{3}}{36}) = 1-\frac{24+5\sqrt{3}}{36} = \boxed{B) \space \frac{12-5\sqrt{3}}{36}}$.
