P1 : $20 \cdot 0.045 \approx 20 \cdot 0.01 = 0.02$ so it's probably $\boxed{B) \space 0.029}$.

P2: We now have $8 \cdot 2.5 = 20$ points, we must now score at least $80$ points. $\lceil \frac{80}{6} \rceil \cdot 6 =  \boxed{C) \space 14}$.

P3: Since $2y$ is even, $x$ is even. Both can just be any even numbers from $2 \le x \le 98$, so total is just $98\div 2 = \boxed{B) \space 49}$.

P4: We are confirmed 6 daughters, so 4 of these daughters must have 6 daughters in order to get $6 + 4 \cdot 6 = 30$. Thus, 2 daughters have no descendants and all 24 grand-daughters have not descendants for a total of $2 + 24 = \boxed{E) \space 26}$.

P5: We can estimate by the picture that $b \approx 0.8$ and $m \approx -0.5$. Thus, $mb \approx -0.4$ which means its in the range $\boxed{B) \space -1 < mb < 0}$. 

P6: Note that $U-V = 2004^{2005}$ and after this everything will be smaller or equal to $2004^{2005}$ in the larger term, so the difference must be smaller. Thus, it must be $\boxed{A) \space U - V}$.

P7: After the third move, the board looks like $14,13,12$. Thus, I state without proof that after the sixth move, it will look like $13,12,11$ and so on. This is because the idea is always the same, you always pick the largest element, doesn't matter what it is. Thus, I assume that after the $3n$-th move, the board will be $15 - n,14-n,13-n$. We will run out of tokens if the max player has less than 3 tokens which means $15-n = 2, n = 13$. Thus, by then the number of rounds played would be  $3 \cdot 13 = \boxed{D) \space 39}$.

P8: It would be the same as the difference between areas of $\triangle EAB$ and $\triangle CBA$ since they share $\triangle DAB$. Thus, it is easier to just calculate $4 \cdot 8 \div 2 - 4 \cdot 6 \div 2 = 16-12 = \boxed{B) \space 4}$.

P9: Volume of old is $\pi r^2 \cdot h$, volume of new is $\pi (\frac{5}{4}r)^2 h_1 = \pi \frac{25}{16}r^2 h_1 = \pi r^2h$. This means that $\frac{16}{25} = \frac{h_1}{h}$. So the height decreases by $1 - \frac{16}{25} = \frac{9}{25} = \boxed{C) \space 36 \%}$.

P10: Let the first integer be $a$, then $49a + \frac{48 \cdot 49}{2} = 7^5, a+24 = 7^3$. Since there are 49 numbers, the 25th position is the median so its just $\boxed{C) \space 7^3}$.

P11: If she had one more quarter, average goes up by 1 cent, meaning there are 25 coins in her bag after adding, 24 coins before adding. Thus, her total amount is $24 \cdot 20 = 480$. Greedily adding we have $480 =
