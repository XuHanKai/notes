P1: $18 \cdot 4 - 2 \cdot 4 = \boxed{C) \space 64}$.

P2: $10 \cdot 20 = \boxed{E) \space 200}$.

P3: $3x = 4(x-4), x =16, 16 \cdot 3 = \boxed{D) \space 48}$.

P4: $400e = 400 \cdot 1.3 =  520, \frac{520-500}{500} = \boxed{B) \space 4}$.

P5: $41-26$ is odd and $57 = 41$ is even. The must exist odd+even = odd for $41-26$. Thus, minimum is $\boxed{A) \space 1}$.

P6: $x+c - (y-c) = x-y + 2c$. Thus, $\boxed{\textnormal{A) Her estimate is larger than x-y}}$.

P7: $10 \cdot 5 + 1 - 6 = 45$ lights between. $45 \cdot 0.5 = \boxed{E) \space 22.5}$.

P8: Working starting from the cake (fixed), $3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = \boxed{A) \space 729}$.

P9: $d = 60a = 24(a+b), 36a = 24b, b = \frac{3}{2}a, \frac{d}{b} = \frac{60a}{\frac{3}{2}a} = \boxed{B) \space 40}$.

P10: By [[Conics]], the second graph is a ellipse. By [[Transformations]], it has center $(4,0)$ and since $3y = f(x)$ means $y=\frac{f(x)}{3}$, it has vertical shrink by factor of $3$. It should have three intersections at $(-5,0), (4,3), (4,-3)$ since radius of large ellipse is 9. Thus, $6 \cdot 9 \div 2 = \boxed{B) \space 27}$.

P11: $A^2 + 3A + 2 + 4(A+1) + 3 = 6(2A+1)+9, A^2-5A -6 = 0, A = 6, A+B = 6+7 = \boxed{C) \space 13}$. 

P12: $2 \cdot \binom{21}{2} = 420$ counts all zeros consecutive and all ones consecutive where we set the left and right bounds (21 since you can also choose $l=r$). We overcounted the number of ways for both zero and ones overlap exactly once. Both is $2 \cdot 20 = 40$ since we pick splitting point, so everything to left is white and right is black so 20 choices, then flip so 2 choices. Note previously we counted cases "11...1" and "00...0" exactly once (and didn't over count), and now here we've also subtracted each of this exactly once, so it worked out and we eliminated these special cases. We have $420-40 = \boxed{D) \space 380}$. 

P13:
