p1: $(2x+3)(2x-10) = 0, x = -\frac{3}{2}, 5$. Sum is $\boxed{A) \space \frac{7}{2}}$.

p2: $\frac{x-9}{3}=43, x = 138.$ $\frac{138-3}{9} = \boxed{A) \space 15}$.

p3: $2^{16},16^2$ so $\boxed{C) \space 2}$.
==sussy guess==

p4: complement = sum up to 90, supplement = sum up to 180. Angle must be <= 90 cause it has a complement. We have $90-x = \frac{1}{4}(180-x), 45 = \frac{3}{4}x, x = \boxed{B) \space 60}$.

p5: Radius of big circle = $1 + 2\cdot 1 = 3$. Shaded area is $3^2\pi - 6(1^2\pi) = \boxed{D) \space 3\pi}$.

p6: Spam 1 $\boxed{\textnormal{E) infinitely many}}$. 

p7: $\frac{1}{8}\cdot 2\pi a = \frac{1}{12} \cdot 2\pi b, \frac{a}{b} = \frac{8}{12} = \frac{2}{3}.$ Because we are squaring, area ratio is $\boxed{A) \space \frac{4}{9}}$.
==easier?==

p8: By one-one correspondance we can try and get $\boxed{A) \space B=W}$.
==didnt check other options==

p9: We have $30-3-12=15$ 0.4 files. Greedily, we pair up 0.8 with 0.4 aand 0.7 with itself. For 0.7, we use 6 disks. For 0.8, we use 3 disks and there are 12 0.4 files left. We then fit 3 in each disk a total of 4. Thus the sum is $6+3+4 = \boxed{B) \space 13}$.

p10: After first pour, we have 2 ounce coffee, 2 ounce coffee + 4 ounce cream in the two cups respectively. After second pour,  we have 2 +1 ounce coffee + 2 ounce cream, 1 ounce coffee + 2 ounce cream in the two cups respectively. Thus, the fraction of cream in the first cup is $\boxed{D) \space \frac{2}{5}}$.

p11: Let $x$ be the minutes he's supposed to take to arrive. We get $40/60(x+3) = 60/60(x-3)$ since they will both equal the distance, and we divide by 60 cause we convert speed into miles per minute. Thus, $40/60x+2 = 60/60x-3,5 = 20/60x, x = 15$ minutes which is $\frac{1}{4}$ hours. Then, distance is $60/60(15-3) = 12$ miles. We then need to drive $\frac{12}{\frac{1}{4}} = \boxed{B) \space 48}$.

p12: By [[Vietas Formula]], We have $63$ is the sum of two primes. Bruteforcing, we have pairs: $(2,61)$ and thats it because it must be even+odd = odd. Thus, there is one pair of solutions so $\boxed{B) \space 1}$.

p13: Since $a$ and $b$ are different, it is probably that $a = \frac{1}{a} + 1$ and $b = \frac{1}{b} - 1$. We solve for each separately: $a^2=1+a, a^2-a-1 = 0, a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$, and $b^2 = 1-b,b^2+b-1 = 0, b = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$. Thus, $a+b = \boxed{C) \space \sqrt{5}}$.
==easier way? (small optimization)==

p14: By [[Logorithm]] rules, $f(11)+f(13)+f(14) = \log_{2002}{11^2\cdot 13^2 \cdot 14^2} = \log_{2002}{2002^2}$ since $11 \cdot 13 \cdot 14 = 2002$. Thus, $\boxed{D) \space N = 2}$.

p15: For mode to be unique and = 8, and median = 8, we just put two 8s in the middle. For mean to be = 8, we can just construct numbers left and right and make them add to 16. For range = 8, we must make the lowest and highest number be close as possible, so just greedily add: $5,6,7,8,8,9,10,11$. Then $11-5 = 6$. We can thus just subtract one from each to make range = 8 exactly, so the sequence is $4,6,7,8,8,9,10,12$. The largest number is thus $\boxed{B) \space 12}$.

p16: We look at it in 2d like $(x,y)$ coordinate represents the first and second roll from Tina, we then get a 5x5 box. It looks like there is symmetry between the diagonal of sums adding up to $2,3,4,5$ and $10,9,8,7$ respectively. If we pair them and add the probabilities up, we get $\frac{8}{10}$ for each $(2,10),(3,9),(4,8),(5,7)$. Excluding the poinys $(x,x)$ since we want distinct numbers, there are $16$ of these points in total, divide by $2$ so $8$ points, each worth $\frac{8}{10}$. Then we worry about the middle diagonal the sums up to $6$ which is $4$ points total( exluding $(3,3)$). Each has probability $\frac{4}{10}$. Thus, total probability is $\frac{8}{20} \cdot \frac{8}{10} + \frac{4}{20}\cdot \frac{4}{10} = \frac{64}{200}+\frac{16}{200} = \frac{80}{200} = \boxed{A) \frac{2}{5}}$. Alternatively we can just say, by symmetry everything pairs up, and along with the middle row, each point averages with a weighting of $\frac{4}{10}$, so we can just say its $\frac{2}{5}$ on average.


==**breakpoint** from mock (spent too long on 16, should've done casework)==

p17: primes are $2,3,5,7$. We try to put largest in ones place. All evens must go tenth place or higher. We have $89,67,41$ is forced and best case scenario. We then put $2,3,5$ in ones place which is best. Thus, sum is $2+3+5+41+67+89 = \boxed{B) \space 207}$.

P18:
