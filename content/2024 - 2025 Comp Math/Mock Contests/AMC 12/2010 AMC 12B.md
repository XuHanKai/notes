P1: Second one took 90 minutes. Thus, total meeting time is $45+90 = 135$ minutes. 9 hours is $9 \cdot 60 = 540$ minutes. The percent of time spent in meetings is $\frac{135}{540} = \boxed{C) \space 25}$.

P2: Area is $2 \cdot 8 + 2 \cdot 3 = \boxed{A) \space 22}$.

P3: All possible values is the divisors of $\gcd(48,64) = 16=2^4$. Thus, total divisors is $\boxed{E) \space 5}$.

P4: This month had exactly 4 Mondays and 4 Wednesdays. Thus, the 3 day interval cannot include either of them. It must be $4,5,6$ or $5,6,7$, so the number of "good" first days is $\boxed{A) \space 2}$.

P5: We have $1-2-3-4+e = 1-(2-(3-(4+e))) = 1-2+3-4-e, -8+e = -2-e, 2e = 6, e = \boxed{B) \space 3}$.

P6: The minimum is 20% changed their answer, where 20% from one side switched to the other. For the maximum, we want as many switches as possible. We let all from one side switch to the other, then let 30% of the other side switch. Thus, total is 50+30% = 80% meaning the difference is $80-20 = \boxed{D) \space 60}$.

P7: Let $x$ be the time she drove in the sun. We have $30x + 20(\frac{2}{3}-x) = 16, 10x+\frac{40}{3} = 16, 10x = \frac{8}{3}, x = \frac{8}{30} = 16$ minutes. Thus, minutes she drove in the rain is $40 - 16 = \boxed{C) \space 24}$.

P8: If She is the median, and we know there are at least 64 kids, it must mean that the total people lies between $64$ and $2 \cdot (37-1) = 72$. Since each person received a different score, the total size must be odd. Thus, the only condition satisfying $64 < 3n < 72$ and $n$ is odd is $\boxed{B) \space 23}$.

P9: If $n^2$ is perfect cube, $n$ is a perfect cube. If $n^3$ is a perfect square, $n$ is a perfect square. Thus, $n = x^6$ for some $x$. We have $20 = 2^2 \cdot 5$. Thus, $n = (2\cdot 5)^6 = 1000000$. The number of digits of $n$ is $\boxed{E) \space 7}$.

P10: We have $\frac{4950 + x}{100} = 100x, 4950+x = 10000x, x = \frac{4950}{9999} = \boxed{B) \space \frac{50}{101}}$.

P11: ==Hint: What makes a 4 digit palindrome divisible by 7? We have $abba = 1000a + 100b+10b + a \equiv 110b \equiv 5b \pmod{7}$.== Thus, $b$ must be divisible by $7$ and we don't care about $a$. There is only one choice $b=7$ for $b$. Thus, total palindromes divisible by $7$ is $9 \cdot 1 = 9$. Total 4 digit palindromes is $9 \cdot 10 = 90$. Thus, probability is $\boxed{A) \space \frac{1}{10}}$.

P12: By [[Logorithm]] rules, this is just $5 \cdot \log_{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{x} = 40, \log_{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{x} = 8, \sqrt{x} = 16, x = \boxed{D) \space 256}$.

P13: Since 1 is the upper bound of trig functions, we have $cos(2A-B)=1$ and $sin(A+B)=1$. One simple configuration is $2A-B = A+B = 90^{\circ}. A = 2B, A = 60^{\circ}, B = 30^{\circ}$. Thus, we can say that $\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle at $\angle C$, where $AB$ is the hypotenuse. Thus, $BC = \boxed{C) \space 2}$.

P14: To minimize the maximum, we want to make the pair sums as close as possible. Thus, we have $a = c = e$ and $b = d$ and we want to minimize $a+b$. We have $3a+2b = 2(a+b)+a = 2010$. Thus, we want to maximize $a$ and minimize $b$. Let $b=1$, we thus have $3a = 2009$. Thus, we can have the biggest of $a,c,e$ be $670$. So we have $669+1+669+1+670$. Thus, $a+b = \boxed{B) \space 671}$.
