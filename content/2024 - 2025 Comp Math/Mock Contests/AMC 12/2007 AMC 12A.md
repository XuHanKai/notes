P1: Susan paid $4 \cdot 20 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = 60$ and Pam paid $5 \cdot 20 \cdot {7}{10} = 70$. Thus, the amount that Pam paid more than Susan is $70-60 = \boxed{C) \space 10}$. 

P2: The height it will rise is $\frac{40 \cdot 20 \cdot 10}{100 \cdot 40}  = \boxed{D) \space 2}$.

P3: It's just 1 and 3, so $1+3=\boxed{A) \space 4}$.

P4: Total time is $0.5 + 1.5 =2$ hours. Total distance is $16 \cdot 0.5 + 1.5 \cdot 4 = 8+6 = 14$. Thus, average speed is $\frac{14}{2} = \boxed{A) \space 7}$.

P5: Let $x$ be his original inheritance. We have $0.2x + 0.1 \cdot 0.8x = 10500 = 0.28x, x = \frac{10500}{0.28} = \boxed{D) \space 37500}$.

P6: We have $\angle BAD = \angle BCD$ and $\angle BAD + \angle BCD = 360^{\circ} - 40^{\circ} - (360^{\circ}-140^{\circ}) = 100^{\circ}$ so $\angle BAD = \frac{100^{\circ}}{2} = \boxed{D) \space 50}$.

P7: Let $k$ be the difference, then $(c-2k)+(c-k)+c+(c+k)+(c+2k) = 30 = 5c, c = 6.$ Thus, the letter that can be found is $\boxed{C) \space c}$.

P8: By vertex, the clock is split into 12 arcs each with angle $36^{\circ}$. The angle inscribed by chords 12 to 5 and 5 to 10 will include all arcs 10-11 and 11-12 which has arc of $36^{\circ}+36^{\circ}=72^{\circ}$. Thus, $\angle (12,5,10) = \frac{72^{\circ}}{2} = \boxed{D) 36}$.

P9: Let $\frac{a}{b}$ be ratio of distance to home over total distance, and also the time ratio if Yan has constant speed is the same as well. Thus let $a$ and $b$ instead represent the time it take, $\frac{b}{7} = b-2a, b = 7b-14a, 14a = 6b, \frac{a}{b} = \frac{6}{14} = \frac{3}{7}$. Thus, ratio is $3 : (7-3) = \boxed{B) \space 3 : 4}$.

P10: Let the lengths of the triangle be $3x,4x,5x$. It is a right triangle, meaning that $5x = 6, x = \frac{6}{5}$. Thus, the area is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 3(\frac{6}{5}) \cdot 4(\frac{6}{5}) - \frac{216}{25} = \boxed{A) \space 8.64}$. 

P11: Don't know systematic approach, just try to generating some sequences and eliminate choices. We have $\{111\}$ is not divisible by $7,13,43$. Thus, only $3$ and $37$ remain. For every number $x$, it will appear 3 times in each digit position because it will look like $\_ax,axb,xb\_$. Thus, the sum is a factor of $111$ which means the largest prime factor, as predicted, is $\boxed{D) \space 37}$.

P12: It must either be odd-odd or even-even. For odd-odd, it must be that all of $a,b,c,d$ is odd. There are $2008 \div 2 = 1004$ odd numbers, so exactly half are even and half are odd. Thus, probability is $(\frac{1}{2})^4 = \frac{1}{16}$. If even-even, it means that at least one term from each is even. Thus, probability for that term is $1-\frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$. Thus, probability of even-even is$(\frac{3}{4})^2 = \frac{9}{16}$. Total probability is $\frac{1}{16} + \frac{9}{16} = \boxed{E) \space \frac{5}{8}}$.

P13: Let $ C = (12,10)$. We don't care about $(4,-2)$ since the answer is the point $A$ on line $l$ denoted by $y=-5x+18$ such that $AC \perp l$. In other words, the point that is the perpendicular leg on $l$ with $C$. Line $AC$ must then have slope $\frac{1}{5}$. We have $10 = \frac{1}{5} \cdot 12 + b, b = \frac{38}{5}$. Thus, we have $(a,b)$ where $b = -5a+18=\frac{1}{5}a+\frac{38}{5}, \frac{52}{5} = \frac{26}{5}a. a = 2, b = 8$ which means $a+b = \boxed{B) \space 10}$.

P14: We have $45 = 3^2 \cdot 5$. Since the factors are all integers, we must construct $45$ with integers only, and they have to be distinct. We exploit 1s and find $45 = 1 \cdot -1 \cdot -3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$. Thus, $30 - (a+b+c+d+e) = 5, (a+b+c+d+e) = \boxed{C) \space 25}$.

P15: The mean is $\frac{28+n}{5}$. The mean can only be $6,n,9$. If median is $6$, $n=2$ which works. If median is $n$, $n = 7$ which works. If median is $9$, $n = 17$ which works. Thus, sum of all possible $n$ is $2+7+17 = \boxed{E) \space 26}$.

P16: This is the hard version of P11 on [[2005 AMC 12A]]. Again, if we choose the first two digits the last digit is fixed. The average is different from the two chosen digits as well. Moreover, they must both be odd or even. For both odd, there are $\binom{5}{2}=10$ choices for numbers, and $3!$ ways to permute for a total of $10 \cdot 6 = 60$. For even case, if we pick 0, there are $4$ choices and $4$ ways to permute for a total of $16$ ways. If we don't pick $0$, there are $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways and $3!$ ways to permute for a total of $36$ ways. Thus, total ways is $60 + 16 + 36 = \boxed{C) \space 112}$.

P17: We have $\cos(a-b) = \cos{a}\cos{b} + \sin{a}\sin{b}$. Thus, we try to construct these terms. We have 
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{5}{3} + 1 &= (\sin{a}+\sin{b})^2 + (\cos{a}+\cos{b})^2 \\
&= \sin^2{a}+sin^2{b}+2\sin{a}\sin{b} + \cos^2{a}+cos^2{b}+2\cos{a}\cos{b} \\
&= (\sin^2{a}+\cos^2{a}) + (\sin^2{b} + \cos^2{b}) +2(\cos{a}\cos{b}+\sin{a}\sin{b}) \\
&= 2+ 2\cos(a-b), \\
\frac{2}{3} &= 2\cos(a-b), \\
\cos(a-b) &= \boxed{B) \space \frac{1}{3}}.
\end{align}
$$

P18: Because $f(x)$ has real coefficients, $2-i$ is also a solution and the last solution is in the form $xi$ for constant $x$. The sum is $2i+2+i+2-i+xi=(2+x)i+4$. Thus, it must be that $x = -2$ which means the roots are $2i,-2i,2-i,2+i$. Then, 
$$
\begin{align}
a &= -4, \\
b &= (2i)(-2i) + 2i(2-i+2+i) + -2i(2-i+2+i)+(2-i)(2+i) = 4 + 0 + 5 = 9,\\
c &= -((2i)(-2i)(2+i)+(2i)(-2i)(2-i)+(2i)(2-i)(2+i)+(-2i)(2-i)(2+i)) = -16, \\
d &= (2i)(-2i)(2-i)(2+i) = 20.
\end{align}
$$
Thus, $a+b+c+d = \boxed{D) \space 9}$.
