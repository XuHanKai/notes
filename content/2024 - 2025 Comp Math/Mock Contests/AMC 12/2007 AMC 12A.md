P1: Susan paid $4 \cdot 20 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = 60$ and Pam paid $5 \cdot 20 \cdot {7}{10} = 70$. Thus, the amount that Pam paid more than Susan is $70-60 = \boxed{C) \space 10}$. 

P2: The height it will rise is $\frac{40 \cdot 20 \cdot 10}{100 \cdot 40}  = \boxed{D) \space 2}$.

P3: It's just 1 and 3, so $1+3=\boxed{A) \space 4}$.

P4: Total time is $0.5 + 1.5 =2$ hours. Total distance is $16 \cdot 0.5 + 1.5 \cdot 4 = 8+6 = 14$. Thus, average speed is $\frac{14}{2} = \boxed{A) \space 7}$.

P5: Let $x$ be his original inheritance. We have $0.2x + 0.1 \cdot 0.8x = 10500 = 0.28x, x = \frac{10500}{0.28} = \boxed{D) \space 37500}$.

P6: We have $\angle BAD = \angle BCD$ and $\angle BAD + \angle BCD = 360^{\circ} - 40^{\circ} - (360^{\circ}-140^{\circ}) = 100^{\circ}$ so $\angle BAD = \frac{100^{\circ}}{2} = \boxed{D) \space 50}$.

P7: Let $k$ be the difference, then $(c-2k)+(c-k)+c+(c+k)+(c+2k) = 30 = 5c, c = 6.$ Thus, the letter that can be found is $\boxed{C) \space c}$.

P8: By vertex, the clock is split into 12 arcs each with angle $36^{\circ}$. The angle inscribed by chords 12 to 5 and 5 to 10 will include all arcs 10-11 and 11-12 which has arc of $36^{\circ}+36^{\circ}=72^{\circ}$. Thus, $\angle (12,5,10) = \frac{72^{\circ}}{2} = \boxed{D) 36}$.

P9: Let $\frac{a}{b}$ be ratio of distance to home over total distance, and also the time ratio if Yan has constant speed is the same as well. Thus let $a$ and $b$ instead represent the time it take, $\frac{b}{7} = b-2a, b = 7b-14a, 14a = 6b, \frac{a}{b} = \frac{6}{14} = \frac{3}{7}$. Thus, ratio is $3 : (7-3) = \boxed{B) \space 3 : 4}$.

P10: Let the lengths of the triangle be $3x,4x,5x$. It is a right triangle, meaning that $5x = 6, x = \frac{6}{5}$. Thus, the area is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 3(\frac{6}{5}) \cdot 4(\frac{6}{5}) - \frac{216}{25} = \boxed{A) \space 8.64}$. 

P11: Don't know systematic approach, just try to generating some sequences and eliminate choices. We have $\{111\}$ is not divisible by $7,13,43$. Thus, only $3$ and $37$ remain. For every number $x$, it will appear 3 times in each digit position because it will look like $\_ax,axb,xb\_$. Thus, the sum is a factor of $111$ which means the largest prime factor, as predicted, is $\boxed{D) \space 37}$.

P12: It must either be odd-odd or even-even. For odd-odd, it must be that all of $a,b,c,d$ is odd. There are $2008 \div 2 = 1004$ odd numbers, so exactly half are even and half are odd. Thus, probability is $(\frac{1}{2})^4 = \frac{1}{16}$. If even-even, it means that at least one term from each is even. Thus, probability for that term is $1-\frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$. Thus, probability of even-even is$(\frac{3}{4})^2 = \frac{9}{16}$. Total probability is $\frac{1}{16} + \frac{9}{16} = \boxed{E) \space \frac{5}{8}}$.
