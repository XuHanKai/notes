P1: $20-2010+201+2010-201+20 = \boxed{C) \space 40}$.

P2: The boat makes $15-10+1 = 6$ trips, so we have $100 +99 + 98 + 97 + 96 + 95 = 600 - (5)(6)/2 = \boxed{A) \space 585}$. 

P3: Let $M$ be the midpoint of $AB$. We have $EF = AM = 5AD$. Thus, $\frac{AB}{AD} = \boxed{E) \space 10}$.

P4: A,B can't be positive since it has negative term. x will not affect signs in C, and its negative as well. In E, cube root of negative is negative. Thus, it must be $\boxed{D) \space -x^{-1}}$.

P5: She and her opponent both have 50 shots left. Let her opponents score be $x$. Worst case scenario, Chelsea's score at the end is $(x+50)+10n + (50-n)4 = x + 6n +250$ and her opponent's score is $x + 500$. Thus, we want $6n>250, n > 250/6$ which means minimum $n$ is $\lceil\frac{251}{6}\rceil = \boxed{C) \space 42}$.

P6: It must mean that the palindromes are in the forms $9a9$ and $1bb1$. Thus, we have $9a9 + 32 = 900 + 10a+30 + 11 = 941 + 10a = 1yy1$. Thus, we may have $a =6$ which means $x = 969$. Sum of digits of $xx$ is $\boxed{E) \space 24}$.

P7: Sphere means the ratio is shrank to the power of 3. If $100000$ shrinks to $0.1$, then the side length ratio must be $100 : 1$. Thus, the height of his tower should be $\frac{40}{100} = \boxed{C) \space 0.4}$.

P8: Since $\angle ACD = \angle BAE, \triangle AFC \sim \triangle AEB$. Moreover, since $\frac{AC}{AB} = \frac{1}{2},$ we have $AE = 2AF = AF+FE$ which means $AF = FE = CF$. Thus, $\triangle AFC$ is an isosceles triangle where $\angle AFC = 180^{\circ}-60^{\circ} = 120^{\circ}$. Thus, $\angle ACF = 30^{\circ}$ so $\angle ACF + \angle FCE = 30^{\circ}+60^{\circ}=90^{\circ}$.

P9: Each cut takes away $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 12$ and we do 3 cuts in total with each cut eliminating an axis. However, we overcounted the middle $2 \times 2 \times 2$ cube two times. Thus, we actually subtracted $3 \cdot 12 - 2 \cdot 2^3 = 20$ from the original volume which is $3^3 = 27$. The volume of the remaining solid is then $27-20 = \boxed{A) \space 7}$.

P10: The difference is $9-p = 3p-q-9 = 2q$. Thus, $18+q = 4p$, $3p-9 = 3q$, and $9-p = 2q$. Manipulating and combining equations 2 and 3, we have $3p-9 + 3(9-p) = 18 = 3q + 3(2q) = 9q, q = 2$. Thus, difference is $2(2) = 4$ and starting value is $9-2q = p = 5$. The 2010th term of this sequence is then $5 + (2009)4 = \boxed{A) \space 8041}$.

P11: $7^{log_7(8)} = 8$. Then, $7^{xlog_7(8)} = 8^x, log_7(8)x = x+7$. Thus, $x = \frac{7}{log_7(8)-1}$ which means $b^{\frac{7}{log_7(8)-1}} = 7^7, b = 7^{log_7(8)-1} = \frac{7^{log_7(8)}}{7} = \boxed{C) \space \frac{8}{7}}$.

P12: Between LeRoy and Chris, one of them must be toad and the other is frog. If Brian is toad, Mike is a frog which means Mike is telling truth. However, Mike is lying which contradicts himself. Thus, Brian is a frog and Mike is a frog. Thus number of frogs is $\boxed{D) \space 3}$.

P13: If they intersect, we have $x^2+y^2=(xy)^2$. By [[SFFT]], we have $(xy)^2+x^2+y^2+1-1 = (x^2-1)(y^2-1) -1 = 0, (x^2-1)(y^2 - 1) = 1.$
