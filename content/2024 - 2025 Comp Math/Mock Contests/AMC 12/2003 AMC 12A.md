P1: For every odd number, there is a [[Bijection]] of an even number bigger by 1. Thus difference is $\boxed{D) \space 2003}$.

P2: T-shits cost $\$9$. Socks + shirt costs $4+9 = \$13$. Total cost for one player is $2 \cdot 13 = \$26$. Thus, $2366 \div 26 = \boxed{B) 91}$.

P3: There are 8 corners, volume of each removed cube is $3^3 = 27$. Total volume removed is $8 \cdot 27 = 216$. Total volume of original volume is $15 \cdot 10 \cdot 8 = 1200$. Thus, $\frac{216}{1200} = \frac{9}{50} = \boxed{D) \space 18\%}$.

P4: In total, she walked 2km in 40mins. Thus, $\frac{2}{40} \cdot \frac{60}{1} = \boxed{A) \space 3}$.

P5: We have $AMC + AMC = 1234$ since we don't have carries from 10 and 12. Thus, $AMC = 1234 \div 2 = 617$, so $A+M+C = \boxed{E) \space 14}$.

P6: Note last 3 is always true, and yes A is true as well. Thus by process of elimination we pick $\boxed{B) \space 2(x\heartsuit y) = (2x) \heartsuit (2y)}$.

P7: If largest side >= 4, it won't work cause sum of two smaller sides is 3 or smaller. If largest side is 3, we have 1-3-3 and 2-2-3.  If largest side is 2 it's impossible. Thus, number of good triangles is $\boxed{B) \space 2}$.

P8: $60 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$, so total number of factors is $3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 12$. Positive factors of 60 smaller than 7 is $1,2,3,4,5,6$. Thus, probability is $\frac{6}{12} = \boxed{E) \space \frac{1}{2}}$.

P9: Since $2 \neq 3$, we must have at least 4 points for it to be symmetrical to both x and y axis. Then, for it to be symmetrical about line $x = y$, we must add 2 more points. Then symmetrical about the origin we add 2 more points for a total of $4+2+2 = \boxed{D) \space 8}$.

P10:
