P1: Top and bottom can always be paired into a $\frac{2}{3}$ ration, so its just $\boxed{C) \space \frac{2}{3}}$.

P2: 2 weeks = 14 days. $14(2x+1) = 28x+14 = 546, 28x=532, x = \boxed{C) \space 19}$.

P3: The rectangles have areas $4\cdot 5 = 20, 1 \cdot 6 = 6, 2 \cdot 2 = 4, 3 \cdot 7 = 21, 3\cdot 5 = 15$. We sort by ascending and run greedy, so $4,6,15,20,21$ and corresponding costs by greedy are $3,2.5,2,1.5,1$. Thus, least possible cost is $4 \cdot 3 + 6 \cdot 2.5 + 15 \cdot 2 + 20 \cdot 1.5 + 21 \cdot 1 = 12 + 15 + 30 + 30 + 21 = \boxed{A) \space 108}$.

P4: 24 inches = 2 feet. In an hour he can cut $2 \cdot 5000 = 10000$ square feet of grass. Total square feet is $90 \cdot 150 = 13500$ square feet. Thus, the time it will take him is around $\frac{13500}{10000} = \boxed{C) \space 1.35}$.
==stupid wording, idk what the purpose of 28 and 4 overlap is, so the 28 is negligible and we can just replace with 24?==

P5: It's a 3-4-5 triangle, so ratio of horizontal to diagonal is $\frac{4}{5}$. Thus, $27 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{108}{5} = 21.6 \approx \boxed{D) \space 21.5}$.

P6: $r^2 = \frac{6}{2} = 3, r = \pm \sqrt{3}$. Possible first term is $\frac{2}{-\sqrt{3}} = \boxed{B) \space \frac{-2\sqrt{3}}{3}}$.

P7: We can make 835 with $\frac{835}{5} = 167$ nickels and $\frac{835}{10} = \approx 83$ dimes. We separate into min and max cases. Smallest number of dimes: We can assume we have no dimes. Then we have 167, and we can subtract 4 each time from pile and get the same sum (replace five 5s with a 25). $67 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ which is not ideal. We may also
