P1: $5+5+3 = \boxed{D) \space 13}$.

P2: $x+y = 4xy, \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{x+y}{xy} = \boxed{C) \space 4}$.

P3: If he didn't get an $A$, it must be that he did not get everything right (because that would directly contradict the statement). Thus, he got at least one wrong so $\boxed{\textnormal{B) If Lewis did not receive an A, then he got at least one of the multiple choice questions wrong}}$.

P4: $\frac{(1+1) - \sqrt{2}}{1+1} \approx \frac{2-1.4}{2} \approx \boxed{A) \space 30\%}$.

P5: $10 \cdot 20 + \binom{10}{2} = \boxed{B) \space 245}$.

P6: $3+7+d > 15$ and $3+7+15 > d$. Thus, $d > 5$ and $25 > d$. $24 - 6 + 1 = \boxed{D) \space 19}$.

P7: $f(2)=2, f(3) = 3, f(5) = 5, ..., f(2017) = \boxed{A) \space 2017}$.

P8: Cylinder with radius 3 and height $AB$. $216 \pi = 9 \pi \cdot h, AB = h = \boxed{E) \space 24}$.

P9: If $3 = x+2, x = 1, y-4 \le 3, y \le 7$. This is a vertical line. If $3 = y-4, y = 7, x+2 \le 3, x \le 1$. This is a horizontal line. If $x+2 = y-4, x=y+6, 3 \le x+2, 1 \le x$. This is a diagonal line. They do not have a common point, so they are $\boxed{\textnormal{C) three lines whose pairwise intersections are three distinct points}}$.
