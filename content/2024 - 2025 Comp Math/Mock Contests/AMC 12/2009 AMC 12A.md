P1: Her flight took $13:18 - 10:34 = 2:44$. Thus, $h+m = 2 + 44 = \boxed{A) \space 46}$.

P2: $1 + \frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{2}} = 1 + \frac{1}{\frac{3}{2}} = 1 + \frac{2}{3} = \boxed{C) \space \frac{5}{3}}$.

P3: The distance is $\frac{2}{4}$. One third of this is $\frac{1}{6}$. Thus, one third of the way there is $\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{6} = \boxed{B) \space \frac{5}{12}}$.

P4: All choices are multiples of 5, so we can ignore pennies. Note that the minimum value we can do is 20. Since $15<20$, we can't construct $\boxed{A) \space 15}$.

P5: We have $x^3-5 = (x+1)(x-1)x = (x^2-1)x = x^3-x$. Thus, $x = 5$ and $x^3 = \boxed{D) \space 125}$.

P6: We have $12^{mn} = 4^{mn} \cdot 3^{mn} = (2^{2m})^n \cdot (3^n)^m = \boxed{D) \space P^{2m}Q^n}$.  

P7: We have $3x-8 = -2x+12, x= 4$. Thus, starting value is $2(4)-3=5$ and the difference is $3(4)-8=4$. The nth term can then be modelled by $a+(n-1)d = 5+4(n-1) = 1+4n = 2009, n =\boxed{B) \space 502}$.

P8: Let the longer and shorter side be $a$ and $b$ respectively. The side length of the large square is $a+b$ and the smaller square $a-b$. Thus, $a^2+b^2+2ab = (a+b)^2 = 4(a-b)^2 = 4(a^2+b^2-2ab) = 4a^2+4b^2-8ab$. 
Thus, $10ab = 3(a^2+b^2)$. However, I don't see how this leads us anywhere.
We can also look at it as $a+b = 2(a-b), 3b = a, \frac{a}{b} = \boxed{A) \space 3}$.

P9: $F(x)=f((x-3)+3) = 3(x-3)^2+7(x-3)+4 = 3(x^2-6x+9) + 7x-21+4 = 3x^2-11x+10$. Thus, $a+b+c = 3-11+10 = \boxed{D) \space 2}$.

P10: ==Hint: Triangle Inequality==. When they give non-sensical information without any angles to go off of, it is often simple. Note that $DB$ is the hypotenuse of $\triangle TAB$ and a side length of $\triangle DCB$. Moreover, they share the side $DB$. Note that we have $DC + DB < BC, 5+DB > 17$ and $DA+AB > DB, 14 > DB$. Thus, $DB$ is bounded by $12 < DB < 14$ which means $DB = \boxed{C) \space 13}$.

P11: The number of diamonds is just $1+4+8+12+...+. By [[Sequences and Series]], the nth term is
