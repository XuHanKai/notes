 
P1: Switches between $-1$ and $1$. Since there are 2006 numbers in total, it must mean the odds and evens cancel out so sum is $\boxed{C) \space 0}$.

P2: We have $3\spadesuit (4+5)(4-5) = (3+(-9))(3-(-9)) = \boxed{A) \space -72}$.

P3: Let $x$ be Panther's score. $2x+14 = 34, x = \boxed{A) \space 10}$.

P4: The total amount is $8 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 1 - 0.05 = 18.95$, so Mary will receive around $1.05$ in change which $\approx \frac{1}{20}$ converted to percent is $\boxed{A) \space 5}$.

P5: Let number of hours be $t$. Then, $3t + 1= 5t, t = \frac{1}{2}$. Convert this into minutes and we get $\boxed{A) \space 30}$.

P6: For 600 grams of lemonade, total number of calories is $25 + 386 = 411$. Then, 300 grams of lemonade will contain $\frac{200}{600} = \frac{1}{3}$ of that, so $411 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \boxed{137}$.

P7: $2$ choices for who gets to sit in the driver seat, then rest is $3!$ since there are no restrictions. Thus total arrangements is $2 \cdot 3! = \boxed{B) \space 12}$.

P8: We have $1 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2 + a$ and $2 = \frac{1}{4}\cdot 1 + b$. Thus, $a = \frac{1}{2}, b = \frac{7}{4}$, so $a+b = \boxed{E) \space \frac{9}{4}}$.

P9: There is a [[Bijection]] with "choose 3 distinct positive digits", since it can't be 0, and we just sort them (so count all the sets). Then, the largest number in the set must be even.
