P1: For each bedroom, Isabella has to paint $2(12 \cdot 8 + 10 \cdot 8)-60 = 352-60 = 292$ square feet. Thus, in total she must paint $3 \cdot 292 = \boxed{E) \space 876}$.

P2: When he drove home, he used $\frac{120}{30} = 4$ gallons. When he drove back, he used $\frac{120}{20} = 6$ gallons. Thus, average is $\frac{240}{10} = \boxed{B) \space 24}$.

P3: We have $\angle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \angle AOC = \frac{1}{2} (360^{\circ}-260^{\circ}) = \boxed{D) \space 50^{\circ}}$.

P4: So, 9 bananas costs as much as 4 oranges. Thus, we multiply both sides by 2 and get $4 \cdot 2 = \boxed{B) \space 8}$.

P5: If Sam leaves 3 questions unanswered, he gest $4.5$ points. He then needs to correctly answer at least $\lceil \frac{100-4.5}{6} \rceil = \boxed{D) \space 16}$. 

P6: The total distance traveled by the two bugs is $5+6+7 = 18$. Thus, each travelled distance of $9$. Moreover, they meet on line $BC$. Thus, $BD = 9-AB = \boxed{D) \space 4}$.

P7: A possible construction is when $\triangle CDE$ is equilateral. Thus, we have $\angle AED = 90^{\circ} + 60^{\circ} = \boxed{E) \space 150}$.

P8: The current sum of his three children i also $T$. We have $T-N = 2(T-3N) = 2T - 6N,5N = T, T/N = \boxed{D) \space 5}$.

P9: Let $x=2$, then $f(3(2)-1) = f(5) = 2^2 + 2 + 1 = \boxed{A) \space 7}$.

P10: Let $x$ be the size of the original group. Then $\frac{0.4x-2}{x} = 0.3,2 = 0.1x, x = 20$. Thus, the number of girls that were initially in the group is $0.4 \cdot 20 = \boxed{C) \space 8}$.

P11: We have $\angle A + \frac{1}{2}\angle A + \frac{1}{3} \angle A + \frac{1}{4} \angle A = \frac{25}{12}\angle A = 360^{\circ}$. Thus, $\angle A = \frac{4320}{25} = 172.8 \approx \boxed{D) \space 173}$.

P12: Let the score the juniors received be $x$. Then, $0.1x + 0.9 \cdot 83 = 84, 0.1x = 9.3, x = \boxed{C) \space 93}$.

P13: The only time where Leah can see the light switch is when she picks a time no further than the 3 second interval before the color switch. We view this as [[Probability with Geometry]] where we have a length 63 stripe. Then, the area where she sees the color switch is $3+3+3 = 9$. So the probability is $\frac{9}{63} = \boxed{D) \space \frac{1}{7}}$.

P14: Altitudes call for area. Let $x = AB = BC = AC$. The area of $\triangle ABC$ is then $\frac{\sqrt{3}x^2}{4}$. Moreover, area is also just $\frac{1}{2}(x+2x+3x) = 3x$. We have $\sqrt{3}x^2 = 12x, (\sqrt{3}x-12)x = 0, x = \frac{12}{\sqrt{3}} = \boxed{D) \space 4\sqrt{3}}$. 

P15: By [[Sequences and Series]], $7 = \frac{a}{1-r}$ and $3 = \frac{ar}{1-r^2} = \frac{\frac{ar}{1+r}}{1-r}$. Then, $7-3=4=\frac{a}{1-r} - \frac{\frac{ar}{1+r}}{1-r} = \frac{\frac{a}{1+r}}{1-r} = \frac{a}{1-r^2}$. Thus, $\frac{ar}{1-r^2} \cdot \frac{1-r^2}{a} = r = \frac{3}{4}$ which means $a = \frac{7}{4}$. Thus, $a+r = \boxed{E) \space \frac{5}{2}}$.
