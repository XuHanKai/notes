P1: $3 \cdot 5 + 2 \cdot 8 = \boxed{A) \space 31}$

P2: $h \otimes (h \otimes h) = h \otimes (h^3-h) = h^3 - (h^3-h) = \boxed{C0 \space h}$ 

P3: Mary's age is $30 \cdot \frac{5}{3} = \boxed{E) \space 50}$.

P4: We split into minute and hours since they don't affect each other. The max sum of hours digit is $09$ and the max sum of minutes digit is $59$.
Thus, total is $9+5+9 = \boxed{E) \space 23}$.

P5: Total pizza cost is $10$ dollars. Doug ate 3 plain slices which is $8 \cdot \frac{3}{8} = 3$ dollars. Thus, Dave paid $10-3=7$ dollars, meaning the amount that he paid more than Doug is $7-3 = \boxed{D) \space 4}$.

P6: Label intersections from top to bottom as $E,F,G,H$ to get hexagons $AEFGHD$ and $BEFGHC$. After forming the square, we have $AD + EF = BC + GH$, so $EF = GH$. Moreover, $EF + GH = 8, EF = GH = 4$, so side length of square is $8 + 4 = 12$. We have $18-y = 12, y = \boxed{A) \space 6}$.

P7: Let ages of Mary, Sally, Danielle be $M,S,D$ respectively. We have $1.2S = M, 0.6D = S, D = \frac{5}{3}S$. Thus, the sum of their ages is $M+S+D = 1.2S + S + 1.4S = 3.6S = 23.2, S = \frac{23.2}{3.6} = 6\frac{4}{9}, M = \frac{6}{5}(6 + \frac{4}{9}) = \frac{36}{5} + \frac{5}{9} \approx 7.2 + 0.5 = 7.7$, so on Mary's next birthday she would be $\boxed{B) \space 8}$.

P8: We can just do cases from 5 to 2 since $1+2+3+4+5=15$. We have $\{1,2,3,4,5\}, \{4,5,6\}, \{7,8\}$, so number of sets is $\boxed{C) \space 3}$.

P9: $13x + 3y = 100$ so $x$ must be $1 \pmod{3}$ so that $13 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}, 1\cdot 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$. We want to maximize $x$, so $x = 7, 13x = 91$. Then, $y = 3$, and $x+y = \boxed{A) \space 10}$.

P10: $120 - \sqrt{x} = y^2$. There are 10 perfect squares smaller than 120. Thus its just $\boxed{D) \space 10}$.

P11: We have $2xy = 0$, so either $x=0$ or $y=0$, so its just the x and y axis. The graph is thus $\boxed{\textnormal{C) two lines}}$.

P12: We calculate $3+4+...+20 = \frac{18}{2}(23) = 207$. Then, each intersection is length 2 because $1+1 = 2$, and we've overcounted There are $20-3 = 17$ intersections, so we subtract $2\cdot 17 = 34$. Thus, total distance is $207 - 34 = \boxed{B) \space 173}$.

P13: $x+y=3, x+z = 4, y+z = 5$. Thus, $z-y = 1, z = y+1$, so $y+(y+1) = 5, y = 2, z = 3, x = 1$. The sum of area is $(1^2+2^2+3^2)\pi = \boxed{E) \space 14 \pi}$.

P14: Essentially we want to find the minimum positive of $x
