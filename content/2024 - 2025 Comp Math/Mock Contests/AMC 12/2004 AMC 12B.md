P1: We work backwards, so $48,24,12,6,3$. So its $\boxed{A) \space 3}$.

P2: We want to maximize the first term while minimizing d, so d = 0. Then, having 1 on either a or b will result in <= 6. Thus, we want c = 1. Then, either we have $3^2$ or $2^3$. Since $9 > 8$, max value is $\boxed{D) \space 9}$.

P3: $1296 = 36^2 = 2^4 \cdot 3^4$. So $x=4,y=4,  x+y = \boxed{A) \space 8}$.

P4: There are 9 numbers whose ones value is 7. There are 10 numbers whose tens value is 7. There is 1 value 77 where both tens and ones value is 7. Thus, $9+10-1 = 18$. There are $90$ numbers in total, so probability is $\frac{18}{90} = \boxed{B) \space \frac{1}{5}}$.

P5: Ratio is $7:10$. Thus, after exchanging she has $\frac{10}{7}d$ Canadian dollars. This means $\frac{10}{7}d-60=d, \frac{3}{7}d = 60, d = 140$. The sum of the digits of $140$ is $\boxed{A) \space 5}$.
