Why is this a presentation I don‚Äôt know - somebody last year
### How 2 go 2 round 2 on AHSMC (no üß¢) version 2
Last year, math club made a presentation on this contest, so might as well make another one for the quadruple 2. I will just mostly copy what was said last year, plus a few extra stuff. This contest is commonly dubbed as ‚ÄúAMC of Alberta‚Äù. If you get around top 50 Alberta on this contest you get invited to take AHSMC Part 2(‚ÄúAIME of Alberta‚Äù) which is around Feb. Part 1 score doesn‚Äôt contribute to Part 2 score. You are given 80 minutes for 16 multiple choice questions (5 choices each). 

### Funny scoring
When I first heard about this contest in grade 10, I realized the score added up to $80$ instead of $100???$ Turns out you get $20$ points for free. Each correct answer is $5$ points, each question left blank is $2$ points, and each question answered wrong is $0$. Thus, you can at most get a total of $5 \cdot 16 = 80$ points which adds to your $20$ free points for a total of $100$. This creates a [[One to One Correspondence]] with the following rule (==you can think of it like this==): "You are given $52$ points for free. If you get a question wrong, you lose $2$ points, if you get a question right, you gain $3$ points". This makes guessing extremely discourages as the expected value you get with guessing is $\frac{1}{5} \cdot 5 = 1, 1<2$. 

### Cutoff Graph
**Note:** There is only one cutoff and thus only one goal of this contest: to make it to round 2. The cutoffs are somewhere around $80$. I would aim for $82$ or $85$ to be somewhat safe. But who knows, tho unlikely, maybe cutoff will be higher this year hmm...

### Some general tips to make cut off
- Recent cutoff scores for AHSMC Part 1 are around 80, so you just need to do 12 of the 16 questions to make it safely
- This is easier said than done (questions can be pretty sus and hard if you don't know stuff)
- 10 questions + 6 blank = 20 + 10 * 5 + 12 = 82 (what i did last year)
- 11 questions + 5 blank¬† = 20 + 11 * 5 + 10 = 85 (pretty safe tbh)
- I would aim for 11 + 5 blank or 12 + 4 or 3 blank just to be safe
- If you can do more go for it! (but double check ur work tho you dont wanna -3)
- Pls pls pls read questions carefully sometimes it might be sus (2021 P11 was reading comp and I was confused cause I didn't read properly)
- Guess if you can limit down to two choices. This has an expected value of $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 5 = 2.5$ which is greater than $2$. Otherwise, leave it blank.
- Hopefully you have time to check over answers. Making sillies will MASSIVELY destroy your chances here.

### Quotes from ppl I guess
Jason‚Äôs Hottest Tips: Just answer every single question that you can. Then, here is the secret: find the letter that has been the least common. Write that letter down a lot. DEFINITELY do this if the letter has showed up like once (it‚Äôs like statistically proven or something) (For the note 2020-21 part 1 had this distribution so take this with a grain of salt: aabbbbccccddeeee).

Kevin's Tips (2024): disregard what Jason said. Do NOT answer everything you can. Your goal is to make the cutoff, so get 82-85 points. Thus, it would be wise to answer questions ONLY if you're pretty confident with the answer. However, if you find yourself not answering 10 question, then of course just guess. Do what will be best for you in order to get over 80 points. However, don't be scared to answer a question. If you can somewhat confident you can prove the solution then fill it in, but after you hit like 85-90 then it would be wise (in my opinion) to just go back and double check cause it is better to guarantee the cutoff then to get stuff wrong on sillies even if you know how to do it (the worst feeling ever, trust me ~~AMC, CSMC, CCC~~). But who knows, maybe (very unlikely) the questions are super easy this year and the cutoff is 90. Just do what you think is best for you to get in I guess, based on how doable the question are. 

**Sageful Sayings**
- If it‚Äôs in the second half and seems too easy, you probably did it wrong.
- It's almost always not "e) None of these", though it can happen sometimes. If your answer doesn't match the other choices but it's like a few off, maybe just check your work again (for counting problem, make sure you didn't overcount and what not)
- If one of the answers seems stupidly easy to get and generic in comparison to the other answers, it is wrong.
- When in doubt, graph it out (without a graphing calculator).
- If you feel screwed on a problem, look at the answers and find patterns and recognizable stuff
- Check over your answers in the last 20 minutes always (guarantee those 10 questions)
- Fill in your bubbles while you are thinking of approaches to questions (this one is sus btw)
- Sit in the back so that you can look forward into other people‚Äôs work (actually don‚Äôt do this).
- If you have a math shirt wear for good luck

We've attached solutions to problems from the last 5 years of AHSMC Part 1 with this post. We wrote our solutions (may not be the same as official), our mistakes, and general thought process. GLHF tomorrow!
