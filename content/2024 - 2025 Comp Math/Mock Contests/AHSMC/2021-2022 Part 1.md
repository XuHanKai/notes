P1: $3^4 = 81, x^4 = 4$. Note any real number squared is non-negative. Thus, $x^2 = \sqrt{4} = \boxed{B) \space 2}$.

P2: Has side length $5$ as it is 3-4-5 right triangle. Shaded area is square minus triangle area which is $5^2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3 \cdot 4 = \boxed{D) \space 19}$.

P3: Starting on top right corner, we can fix numbers. We have 1 2 3 1 2 from bottom left to top right of the inner 3x3 square. Thus, both 1 and 2 are adjacent to the center, meaning its either 3 or no number is possible. Going around, we find that one configuration of the outer ring of 3x3 (everything except the center) starting from bottom left is 1 2 3 1 2 1 3 2. Thus, only 1 and 2 are next to the center meaning in the center we may only have $\boxed{C) \space 3}$.

P4: $g(g(p)) = g(2p^2) = 2(2p^2)^2 = 8p^4 = 2^3 \cdot p^4$. Since $p\le 3, p \neq 2$ so the number of divisors is $(3+1)(4+1) = \boxed{D) \space 20}$.

P5: $6300 = 3^2 \cdot 7 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 5^2$. We must eliminate $7$, then choose to eliminate any prime or choose not to. Number of subsets of $\{2,3,5\}$ is $\boxed{C) \space 8}$.

P6: $5^{606} \cdot 2^{606} = 10^{606}= \sqrt{A+1}, A = 10^{1212}-1$. Thus, it's just $1212$ 9s in a row. $1212 \cdot 9 = \boxed{E) \space 10908}$.

P7: Each block can be in the form of $4n+1$. We want $\sum_{n = 1}^{}

P8: We want the side it is cut off to have the largest surface area, because to get the new total surface area we add 2 x this sides area to the original surface area. Cutting horizontally would guarantee the maximum. We choose height of 5 and horizontal side with 3 and 4. This forms 3-4-5 right triangle meaning we may have an area of $5 \cdot 5 = 25$. The original surface area is $2(4 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 4) = 94$. Thus, total surface area is $94 + 2 \cdot 25 = \boxed{E) \space 144}$,
**Note: Bad wording they should've said "straight cut" as "vertical" suggests cutting vertically.** 

P9: To maximize $n$, we think of worst case scenario where we want to scatter all the number of toys from 0 to 10 evenly. There are 11 choices for how many toys a child could bring. Thus, $100 \div 11 = 9$ with one left over. By pigeonhole, it must be that $n = 9+1 = \boxed{B) \space 10}$.

P10: Essentially, the problem is asking how many 2021 binary strings start with 1, end with 0, and number of 1s is even. After fixing front and back, we have 2019 digits left. We want the number of 1s in these 2019 digits to be odd. Note by [[Combo Identities]], $\binom{n}{1} +\binom{n}{3} + ... = \binom{n}{0} +\binom{n}{2} + ...  = 2^{n-1}$. Thus, it's just $2^{2019-1} = \boxed{C) \space 2^{2018}}$ .

P11: **Note: problem tests more of reading comprehension skills. The problem asks "what is the smallest number such that, when you see this number, you wouldn't know for sure exactly how many 9 & 10 pods came with it"**. This number must then have at least two valid integers $(x,y), x \ge 0, y \ge 0$ such that $9x+10y = n$. Obviously it is not $1$ so it's not A. For $19$, the only solution is $(1,1)$, so it's not B. For $71$, there are no solutions so it's not C. If we look at $n = 90$, we may have $(10,0)$ or $(0,9)$. Thus, $90$ is a valid $n$. Since $109 > 90$, it is not D. Thus, it's $\boxed{\textnormal{E) none of these}}$. 

P12: 

P13: $\frac{1}{m}+\frac{1}{n} = \frac{m+n}{mn} = \frac{19}{94}, 19mn - 94m-94n = 0$. Using [[SFFT]], we have $(m-\frac{94}{19})(n-\frac{94}{19}) = (\frac{94}{19})^2$. Since $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, let $m_1$ and $n_1$ be positive integers divisible by 19 that satisfy $(\frac{m_1-94}{19})(\frac{n_1-94}{19}) = (\frac{94}{19})^2$, so $m_1 = 19m$ and $n_1 = 19n$. Thus, $(m_1 - 94)(n_1-94) = 94^2 = 2^2 \cdot 47^2$. We first see pair $(1,94^2)$. We have $m_1-94 = 1$ and $n_1-94 = 94^2$ which gets us $m_1 = 95, n_1 = 95(94)$. Note $95$ is divisible by $19$, which satisfies our conditions for $m_1$ and $n_1$. Thus, $m = 95 \div 19 = 5$ and $n = 95(94) \div 19 = 470$, so $m+n = \boxed{D) \space 475}$.

P14: First observe the minimum possible value for $(x-1)^2$ is $0$ which occurs at $x=1$. Thus, absolute value means $f(1) = \frac{1}{2} + a + b = 0, a+b = -\frac{1}{2}$.
