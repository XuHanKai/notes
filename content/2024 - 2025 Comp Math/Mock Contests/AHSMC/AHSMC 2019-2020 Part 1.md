P1: We have $6^2 + 8^2 = 10^2$ (also can note the 3-4-5 triangle). Thus radius is $\boxed{A)\space 10}$.

P2: $b^x = 2^6$ where $x$ is an integer. Divisors of $6$ is $1,2,3,6$. Thus, $b = 2,4,8,64$ so $\boxed{D) \space 4}$.

P3: We want smallest $n$, so we greedily pick $9$ for everything. We have $2019 \div 9= 224 \space r \space 3$. Thus least $n$ is $n = 224 + 1 = \boxed{D) \space 225}$.

P4: To count all the coefficients exactly once, we can use the common trick (also prevalent in authors solution of 2021-2022 P10) where we just make $x=1$. Thus, $a_{2019}+\cdots + a_1 + a_0 = (2(1)^3-1)^{673} = \boxed{B) \space 1}$.

P5: $2020 = 2^2 \cdot 5 \cdot 101$. We we pick a number, we have to pick all of it since no common prime factor. Thus, we want to pick a subset of these 3 numbers to put into the first number, then the rest goes to the second number. Number of ways is just $2^3 = 8$. However, this is if the order of the two numbers mattered. Thus, if it doesn't matter number of ways is $8 \div 2 = \boxed{C) \space 4}$.

P6: For these problems, we want to put them all to the same exponents to visualize better. $\gcd(100,600,300) = 100$. We have $2^{1000}=(2^{10})^{100} = 1024^{100}, 3^{600} = (3^6)^{100} = 729^{100}, 10^{300} = (10^3)^{100} = 1000^{100}$. Now, it is obvious that $729 < 1000 < 1024$, so $\boxed{D) \space b < c < a}$.

P7: $kx^2 + ky^2 + 2x^2+2y^2 \ge 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 4xy, kx^2+ky^2 \ge 4xy, kx^2 + ky^2 - 4xy \ge 0$. One of the only simple and well known ideas surrounding inequality bigger than 0 is $(x+y)^2 \ge 0$ for any real $x$ and $y$. It is easy to see that if $k=2$, the inequality is the same as $2(x-y)^2 \ge 0$. If $k < 2$, we wouldn't be able to complete the square and thus may get negative with the left over from $-4xy$ that isn't in the square. Thus, smallest must be $k = \boxed{C) \space 2}$.

P8: Question asks $a$ such that $x^2 + (1-a)x + 6 = 0$ has exactly one solution. Thus must mean discriminant is 0 so $(1-a)^2 - 4 \cdot 6 = 0, -a^2-2a -23 = 0$. By [[Vietas Formula]], this suggests $a_1 \cdot a_2 = \frac{-23}{-1} = \boxed{C) \space 23}$.

P9: Question asks how many ordered pairs made of numbers from 1 to 100 are there. For every first number, let the second number be not smaller than current number. Thus, we have $100 + 99 + \cdots + 1 = \boxed{A) \space 5050}$.

P10: Two triangles are both right. The angles are separated by the corner of a square which is $90^{\circ}$. Thus, two triangles are similar by AA. The first triangle is a 5-12-13 triangle. This means the ratio of desired height to hypotenuse by similarity is $5 : 13$. Thus, height is $\frac{52}{13} \cdot 5 = \boxed{C) \space 20}$.

P11: To satisfy both 1st and 3rd condition, we have $(\lfloor 2019 \div 2 \rfloor, \lfloor 2019 \div 2 \rfloor+1) = (1009, 1010)$. This doesn't satisfy condition 2, so we just go further apart until we find a pair that satisfies. Note the number that has 1 in front must be the odd one, and is probably the larger one (else if we do 2000 + ... it would probably not be the best answer).  Smallest 4 digit that has all its digits odd is $1111$. $2019 - 1111 = 908$. We want to get rid of the 9, so we try $888$ as the next smallest that has all even digits. $2019 - 888 = 1131$. It works, so the two numbers are $(888,1131)$. Digits of $B$ are even so $B = 888 = 2^3 \cdot 3 \cdot 37$. Thus, largest prime that divides $888$ is $\boxed{E) \space 37}$.

P12: Let weights be such that $a \le b \le c \le d$. The largest and second largest is $c+d = 310, b+d =290$ and the smallest and second smallest is $a+b = 215,a+c=235$. Thus, $c-b = 20$. We have $260$ and $265$ left which is equal to either $b+c$ or $a+d$. For $b+c = 2b+20$, it must be that the sum is even. Thus, it must be that $b+c = 2b+20 = 260, b =120, c = 140$. Thus, $a = 95$ and $d = 170$. We see that $a+d = 95 + 170 = 265$ which satisfies, so the whole list satisfies with the quadruplet $(95,120,140,170)$. Thus, largest number is $\boxed{B )\space 170}$.

P13: It must be that numbers whose difference is even may be in the same set. Thus, numbers with the same parity may be in the same set. We have 5 odds and 4 evens. We either have even and odd each have 1 color so 2 colors total or one of even or odd has 2 colors and the other has 1 so 3 colors total. For the first case, there are $3$ choices for first color (for odd) and $2$ choices for second color (for even), so $3 \cdot 2 = 6$ ways. For second case, there are two cases for which of even or odd set gets the two color, and the other gets the one color. Then, there are $\binom{3}{2} = 3$ ways to choose two colors, then the last color is fixed for the other set. However, note that since we have two colors for one of them, we need to choose for each element in the set whether it has color 1 or 2. If we do 2 colors for odd, 1 color for even, we choose colors for $5$ numbers so $2^5$, so in total $3 \cdot (2^5-2)$ ways (note we erase the case where for the set with 2 colors, all of it is the same color, since that turns it into 2 total colors which is a case we've already counted). If vice versa (2 colors for even, 1 color for odd), we choose for $4$ numbers so $2^4$, so in total $3 \cdot (2^4-2)$ ways. Thus, total number of ways is $6 + 3 \cdot (2^5-2) + 2 \cdot (2^4-2) = 6+3(30)+3(14) = 6+90+42 = \boxed{B) \space 138}$.
(Why do I feel like this is an AMC problem or something)

P14: We have $p(k)=2k^2+1$ for 6 numbers. Thus, we can write
$$
p(x) = a(x-1)(x+1)(x-2)(x+2)(x-3)(x+3) + (2x^2+1)
$$
for some $a$. Then, $-71 = p(0) = a(-1)(1)(-2)(2)(-3)(3) + 1 = -36a + 1, a = 2$. Therefore, we get 
$$
\begin{align}
p(\sqrt{3}) &= 2(3-1^2)(3-2^2)(3-3^2) + (2(3)+1) \\
&= 2(2)(-1)(-6)+7 \\
&= 24+7 = \boxed{D) \space 31}.
\end{align}
$$

P15: Again, these types of problems we usually try to list stuff out. So 
$$
\begin{align}
a_2 &= 3(0-1) = -3, \\
a_3 &= 3(-3-0)=-9, \\
a_4 &= 3(-9-(-3)) = -18, \\
a_5 &= 3(-18-(-9)) = -27, \\
a_6 &= 3(-27-(-18)) = -27, \\
a_7 &= 3(-27-(-27)) = 0, \\
a_8 &= 3(0-(-27)) = 81.
\end{align}
$$The first 8 numbers of the sequence is then $1,0,-3,-9,-18,-27,-27,0,81$. We see $0$ two times here, and the number to the right of $0$ is $-3$ times the number to the left of $0$. Thus, this must be true for every cycle since the pattern will be essentially the same. Thus, we have a cycle of 6 and each cycle is in the form of $0,x,3x,6x,9x,9x$ the continue with $0,-27x,...$ We see that for all indexes that is one after zero, $a_{n} = -27a_{n-6}$. We have $2019 \div 6 \approx 336, 2019 \equiv 3 \pmod{6}$. For this cycle, the starting values are $a_{2017} = 0, a_{2018} = -3\cdot {-3^3}^{336} = -3^{1009}, a_{2019} = 3 \cdot a_{2018} = \boxed{A) \space -3^{1010}}$.
