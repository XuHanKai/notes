P1: We have $6^2 + 8^2 = 10^2$ (also can note the 3-4-5 triangle). Thus radius is $\boxed{A)\space 10}$.

P2: $b^x = 2^6$ where $x$ is an integer. Divisors of $6$ is $1,2,3,6$Thus, $b = 2,4,8,64$ so $\boxed{D) \space 4}$.

P3: We want smallest $n$, so we greedily pick $9$ for everything. We have $2019 \div 9= 224 \space r \space 3$. Thus least $n$ is $n = 224 + 1 = \boxed{D) \space 225}$.

P4: To count all the coefficients exactly once, we can use the common trick (also prevalent in authors solution of 2021-2022 P10) where we just make $x=1$. Thus, $a_{2019}+\cdots + a_1 + a_0 = (2(1)^3-1)^{673} = \boxed{B) \space 1}$.

P5: $2020 = 2^2 \cdot 5 \cdot 101$. We we pick a number, we have to pick all of it since no common prime factor. Thus, we want to pick a subset of these 3 numbers to put into the first number, then the rest goes to the second number. Number of ways is just $2^3 = 8$. However, this is if the order of the two numbers mattered. Thus, if it doesn't matter number of ways is $8 \div 2 = \boxed{C) \space 4}$.

P6: For these problems, we want to put them all to the same exponents to visualize better. $\gcd(100,600,300) = 100$. We have $2^{1000}=(2^{10})^{100} = 1024^{100}, 3^{600} = (3^6)^{100} = 729^{100}, 10^{300} = (10^3)^{100} = 1000^{100}$. Now, it is obvious that $729 < 1000 < 1024$, so $\boxed{D) \space b < c < a}$.

P7: $kx^2 + ky^2 + 2x^2+2y^2 \ge 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 4xy, kx^2+ky^2 \ge 4xy, kx^2 + ky^2 - 4xy \ge 0$. One of the only simple and well known ideas surrounding inequality bigger than 0 is $(x+y)^2 \ge 0$ for any real $x$ and $y$. It is easy to see that if $k=2$, the inequality is the same as $2(x-y)^2 \ge 0$. If $k < 2$, we wouldn't be able to complete the square and thus may get negative with the left over from $-4xy$ that isn't in the square. Thus, smallest must be $k = \boxed{C) \space 2}$.

P8: Question asks $a$ such that $x^2 + (1-a)x + 6 = 0$ has exactly one solution. Thus must mean discriminant is 0 so $(1-a)^2 - 4 \cdot 6 = 0, -a^2-2a -23 = 0$. By [[Vietas Formula]], this suggests $a_1 \cdot a_2 = \frac{-23}{-1} = \boxed{C) \space 23}$.

P9: Question asks how many ordered pairs made of numbers from 1 to 100 are there. For every first number, let the second number be not smaller than current number. Thus, we have $100 + 99 + \cdots + 1 = \boxed{A) \space 5050}$.

P10: Two triangles are both right. The angles are separated by the corner of a square which is $90^{\circ}$. Thus, two triangles are similar by AA. The first triangle is a 5-12-13 triangle. This means the ratio of desired height to hypotenuse by similarity is $5 : 13$. Thus, height is $\frac{52}{13} \cdot 5 = \boxed{C) \space 20}$.

P11: To satisfy both 1st and 3rd condition, we have $(\lfloor 2019 \div 2 \rfloor, \lfloor 2019 \div 2 \rfloor+1) = (1009, 1010)$. This doesn't satisfy condition 2, so we just go further apart until we find a pair that satisfies. Note the number that has 1 in front must be the odd one, and is probably the larger one (else if we do 2000 + ... it would probably not be the best answer).  Smallest 4 digit that has all its digits odd is $1111$. $2019 - 1111 = 908$. We want to get rid of the 9, so we try $888$ as the next smallest that has all even digits. $2019 - 888 = 1131$. It works, so the two numbers are $(888,1131)$. Digits of $B$ are even so $B = 888 = 2^3 \cdot 3 \cdot 37$. Thus, largest prime that divides $888$ is $\boxed{E) \space 37}$.

P12: Let weights be such that $a \le b \le c \le d$. The largest and second largest is $c+d = 310, b+d =290$ and the smallest and second smallest is $a+b = 215,a+c=235$. Thus, $c-b = 20$. We have $260$ and $265$ left which is equal to either $b+c$ or $a+d$. For $b+c = 2b+20$, it must be that the sum is even. Thus, it must be that $b+c = 2b+20 = 260, b =120, c = 140$. Thus, $a = 95$ and $d = 170$. We see that $a+d = 95 + 170 = 265$ which satisfies, so the whole list satisfies with the quadruplet $(95,120,140,170)$. Thus, largest number is $\boxed{B )\space 170}$.

P13: It must be that numbers whose difference is even may be in the same set. Thus, numbers with the same parity may be in the same set. We have 5 odds and
