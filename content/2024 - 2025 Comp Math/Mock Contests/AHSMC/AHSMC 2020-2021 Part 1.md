P1: $\frac{2^a}{2^{2b}} = 16, a=2b+4, a-2b = \boxed{C) \space 4}$.

P2: $x^2 - 61 < x^2 - 16$ since $x^2$ is positive. Thus, we want $x^2 - 61$ to be negative
and $x^2 -16$ to be positive. We have $16 < x^2 < 61$ in which there are 5,6,7. However, we also account for it's negative counter parts for a total of $\boxed{C) \space 6}$.

P3: We can just model using example. We have $3x^2 = 12y^2$. Let first rectangle have lengths $6,2$ and second rectangle be $4,3$. Thus, perimeters are $16 : 14 = \boxed{B) \space 8 : 7}$.

P4: Second condition means $6 + b + 9 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}$. Thus, $b = 3$. $639 - 454 = 1a5, 1a5 = 185$. Thus, $a+b = 8+3 = \boxed{E) \space 11}$.

P5: Easy to calculate by splitting into cases since we only have 2,3,4 digit numbers. For 2 digit numbers, we have 11 to 99 so $9$ ways. For 3 digit we have 9 choices for the first digit (which then fixes the third digit) and ten choices for the second digit, so $9 \cdot 10 = 90$ total. For 4 digits we can either have 1 or 2 for the first digit. If we have 1 as first, we have 10 choices for the second digit so $1 \cdot 10 = 10$. If we have 2 as first, only choice smaller than 2020 is 2002. Thus, only $1$ way. Total number of ways is $9 + 90 + 10 + 1 = \boxed{D) \space 110}$.

P6: $f(-9) = -(f(9)+7) - 7 = 9$, since transition is we essentially just for every coefficient with a variable, switch its sign. $-(f(9)+7) = 16, f(9) = \boxed{A) \space -23}$.

P7: Worst case scenario, an occupied seat block 5 seats (one its sitting on, and 2 on each side). Thus, we may have a row of 10 seats and all can be blocked off by 
2 people. Thus, number of seats at least should be $10 + 2 = \boxed{C) \space 12}$.

P8: If a number is $1 \pmod{3}$, two numbers multiplied would $1 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$. Similarly, $2 \equiv -1 \pmod{3}$ and $-1 \cdot -1 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$. We have $10! = 2^8 \cdot 3^4 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7$. We have $2 \equiv -1 \pmod{3}$, $5 \equiv -1 \pmod{3}$, and $7 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$. The divisor is a chain of even number of -1s and any number of 1s. We can either include 7 or not, so 2 choices. We either need number of 2s and 5s to be both even or both odd, so that their sum is even. If we choose zero 5s, we have $5$ choices for 2. If we choose one 5, we have $4$ choices for 2. If we choose 2 for 5, we have $5$ choices for 2. In total we have $5+4+5 = 14$ choices for 2 & 5. Thus, total ways is $2 \cdot 14 = \boxed{E) \space 28}$.

P9: These types of problems where they give you some weird function and tell you to find the $nth$ number in the sequence where $n$ is some obscurely big number, it's a problem 9 which means it's supposed to be fairly approachable meaning we should almost always just list the first few cases out in hopes of finding a pattern. We have $a_1 = 2, a_2 = 2^2-1 = 3, a_3 = 3^2-1 = 8, a_4 = 8^2-1 = 63, a_5 = 9^2 - 1 = 80, a_6 = 8^2 - 1 = 63$. Note $a_6$ is treated the exact same as $a_4$ and it will infinitely cycle between $8$ and $9$
where all even elements after $4$ is $63$ and all odd elements is $80$. Thus, $a_{2020} = \boxed{D) \space 63}$.

P10: To split into groups where the order of groups matters is $\binom{10}{2} \cdot \binom{8}{2} \cdot \binom{6}{2} = \frac{10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5}{2^3} = 90 \cdot 7 \cdot 30 = 18900$. If order doesn't matter, for each 4 left we would've counted the other three groups of 2 $3!$ times. Thus, $18900 \div 3! = \boxed{B) \space 3150}$.

P11: It must be that $n$ is even or $n$ is odd and $n$ is a perfect square (if n is even and n is perfect square, we've already counted that in first condition). Number of even integers between 1 and 100 is $50$. Number of odd squares between 1 and 100 is $1^2, 3^2, 5^2, 7^2, 9^2$ so $4$ of them. Thus, total is $50 + 5 = \boxed{C) \space 55}$.

P12: Essentially it just length of 3 sides of triangle plus a circle with radius 1, since keeping a distance of 1 means forming a semi-ish arc at each of the corners. Moreover, all external angles add up to $360^{\circ}$, so the path taken together forms a circle. We have $2 + 1 + \sqrt{3} + 1^2\pi = \boxed{A) \space 3+\sqrt{3}+\pi}$.

P13: We want max number such that $1 + 2 + ... + n \le 200$. We have $\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \le 200, n(n+1) \le 400$. $n=20$ would be over, but $n= 19$ would be under. Thus, it's just $\boxed{A) \space 19}$.
(Currently giving me flashbacks of CSMC 2024 A6 and I wanna cry).

P14: Let the roots of the cubic equation be $a,b,c$. By [[Vietas Formula]], $a+b+c = 0, ab + ac + bc = -3, abc = -1$. Thus, the coefficients $p(x)$ are $a^2+b^2+c^2, (ab)^2+(ac)^2+(bc)^2, (abc)^2$ respectively. We know $(abc)^2 = 1$. To get $a^2+b^2+c^2$, we can do 
$$
\begin{align}
(0)^2 &= (a+b+c)^2 \\
&= a^2+b^2+c^2+2(ab+ac+bc) \\
&= a^2+b^2+c^2 + 2(-3), \\
6 &= a^2 + b^2 + c^2.
\end{align}
$$
To get $(ab)^2 + (ac)^2 + (bc)^2$, we can do 
$$
\begin{align}
(-3)^2 &= (ab + ac + bc)^2 \\
&= (ab)^2 + (ac)^2 + (bc)^2 + 2(a+b+c)(abc) \\
&= (ab)^2 + (ac)^2 + (bc)^2 + 2(0)(-1) \\
9 &= (ab)^2 + (ac)^2 + (bc)^2.
\end{align}
$$
Let $p(x) = dx^3 + ex^2 + fx + g$. Thus, $\frac{-e}{d} = 6, \frac{f}{d} = 9, \frac{-g}{d} = 1$. We have $p(0) = g = -4$. Then, it must be that $d = 4, f = 36, e = -24$. Thus, $p(x) = 4x^3 -24x^2 + 36x - 4$. Therefore, $p(4) = 4(64) - 24(16) + 36(4) - 4 = \boxed{E) \space 12}$.

P15: To better visualize, we can let $x=10a+b$. We have
$$
\begin{align}
b^3 &\equiv (10a+b)^3 \pmod{100} \\
& \equiv10^3a^3 + 3(10^2a^2b) +3(10ab^2) + b^3 \pmod{100} \\
& \equiv 30ab^2 + b^3 \pmod{100} \\
0 &\equiv 30ab^2.
\end{align}
$$
Note all pairs $(a,b)$ such that $1 \le a \le 9$ and $0 \le b \le 4$ (since if $b>4, b^3>100$). We have $30ab^2 = 100c$ for some non-negative integer $c$. Thus, $3ab^2 = 10c$ meaning we have the following 4 cases (since all are integers). 
Case 1, if $a$ is multiple of $10$, $b = anything$: There are no other multiple of 10s that can be a digit other than $0$. However, $a$ cannot be $0$ by our bounds, so $0$ ways. 
Case 2, if $b$ is a multiple of $10$, $a = anything$: We fixed $b$ and there are $9$ choices for $a$, so $9$ ways.
Case 3, if $b$ is multiple of $2$, $a$ is multiple of $5$: There are two choices for $b$ that's in bounds and $1$ choice for $a$, so $2$ ways.
Case 4, if $b$ is a multiple of $5$, a is a multiple of $2$: the first multiple of $5$ other than $0$ (which we already accounted for) is $5$ which is not in bounds. Thus, there are $0$ ways.
Total ways is $0+9+2+0 = \boxed{B )\space 11}$.


P16: If you think about it, it's like an equilateral triangle with an length $r$ line extending past each vertex, where each vertex is the center. The median of this center is the center of the bigger circle with radius $10$. We have $r + \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}r = \frac{2+\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}r = 10$. Solving this yields $r = \frac{10\sqrt{3}}{2+\sqrt{3}} = 10\sqrt{3}(2-\sqrt{3}) = 20\sqrt{3} - 30 = \boxed{B) \space 10(2\sqrt{3}-3)}$.
