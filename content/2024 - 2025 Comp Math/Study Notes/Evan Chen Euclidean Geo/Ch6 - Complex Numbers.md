### 6.1 Definition
A **complex number** is a number in the form of $z = a+bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i = \sqrt{-1}$. The real part is denoted as $a = Re(z)$. 
Every complex number can be expressed in **polar form** as 
$$
z = r(\cos{\theta}+i\sin{\theta}) = re^{i\theta}
$$
for some nonnegative real $r$ (by **Euler's formula** which states $e^{i\theta} = \cos{\theta}+i\sin{\theta}$). Thus, every complex number can be plotted on the complex plane as point $(a,b)$.
