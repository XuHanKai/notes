Let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $I$ to $BC$.

First, we will prove that if $AH$ is parallel to $BC$, then $H$ lies on the circle. Since $H$ is the orthocenter of $\triangle BIC$, $H$ is perpendicular to $BC$ which means $\angle BDH = 90^{\circ}$. Since $AH$ is parallel to $BC$, $\angle AHI = \angle BDH = 90^{\circ}$. By a well-known theorem, if we know that $AI$ is the diameter of a circle $O$ and $\angle AHI = 90^{\circ}$, then point $H$ is on circle $O$. Since we have proven  $\angle AHI = 90^{\circ}$, $H$ must lie on the circle.

Now we will prove that if $H$ lies on the circle, then $AH$ is parallel to $BC$. Since $H$ is on the circle with diameter $AI$, $\angle AHI = \angle AHD = 90^{\circ}$. We also know that $\angle BDH = 90^{\circ}$. Because $D$ is on $BC$, $HD$ is perpendicular to both $BC$ and $AH$. Thus, $AH$ and $BC$ must be parallel.

#### Part b)
Let $p$ be the perimeter of $\triangle ABC$. Let $R$ be the radius of circumcircle. Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Based on Eulerâ€™s formula, $IO^2 = R^2 - 2Rr$.
