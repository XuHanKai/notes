### Question 1
Tell us about a passion or strong interest of yours. How (and when) did you become involved in this interest (and for how long have you been involved)? What have you learned about yourself from this interest? How will you apply this knowledge as a student at the University of Waterloo? (900-character limit)

**Planning:**
CS route
- CP
	- Hard work != success
		- Each person improves at their own pace
	- I hate life
	- Work pays off eventually
	- ICPC
	- Interested in Math and Proofs and stuff
- Webdev
	- How to talk to people
	- Developed websites for school
	- Endless opportunity
	- 

**Rough Draft**
One of my main passions is different types of coding. I think coding can be really fun and have lots of freedom on what to do. It's a tool that can be a great way to reach people. Coding also improved my personal abilities such as problem solving, being creative, and communicating with others.

I do CP and it's really hard since you have to grind a lot. When I started I just treated it like a game and it was addictive. I learned that I'm the type of guy that likes to grind. I also like to play a lot of video games for the purpose of getting good. I would do whatever it takes to grind. When I'm invested, there is no stopping. I love the dopamine rush, it's like beating a game level.

With CP I learned various problem solving techniques. I was never challenged with school math subjects. So doing CP was hard because the problems are quite challenging. Each problem was like ad-hoc and you have to actually induct the solution using pure problem solving skills instead of relying on memory. It's very hard cause even in math problems you might've seen the same type of problem before, but in CP every problem is different. Difficult problems you probably never encountered the same procedure before.

Also CP has punished me on my communication skills. I used to just grind silently, but I realized that doing it with friends is cool. Also I used to think that with myself and google I would be good, but I noticed that having a coach or a friend can push you a lot.

CP also affected me mentally as it made me feel bad cause I see people around me progress faster than me. I've had thoughts where I think I'm not cut for CP, I'm not gifted. Thus it made me realize that hard work does not always mean success and that people progress at different rates. Online contests have allowed me to build a strong mental endurance being able to recover from loss easily. 

However, I have made some noticeable progress, such as my ability to automatically come up with different methods of attack as well as my problem solving and coding skills.

I also do webdev. This also helped me on my communication. One example was when I attended a hackathon when I realized networking and working with a team is important. In short knowing programming helped me realize I have to put myself out there.

Thus I have began to reach out to people. I'm working on some projects so far. With the knowledge of coding, I became more aware of the problems around me and the improvements I can imagine making. Thus I've taken on several web projects that may help people in my school.

I think I can help improve waterloo through CP because I can, along with my peers, figure out problems together. With my problem solving skills we can hopefully arrive at a solution. I think waterloo is full of people who grind and are problem solvers who wants to figure things out. I think I can persist a problem and eventually we'll figure things out.
I will use my webdev skills to create a better experience for users and advertise stuff when needed.

**Edit 1:** 
- Organize Structure 
- Main points (concise) -> word reduction
- Should I use CP or Webdev specifics (dont have space to write both)


**Topic - CP**

I began to do Competitive Programming (CP) back in middle school after seeing it on Youtube and it looked cool. 

Throughout my journey CP since grade 9 (4 years), I spent endless nights developing my problem solving skills, learning interesting algorithms, and debugging code. 

Other than improving my thinking, CP has taught me to develop a good mindset in life. I have failed countless times. This slowly developed my ability to deal with failure. I learned to come back from a negative mindset and think positively. Currently, this has become a strong selling point of my mentality, giving me confidence to persist. I always think that if I can handle CP, I can handle whatever hardship I'm doing, since I already failed countless times already. Over the years, I've seen a lot of my peers progress faster. There were times were I doubted my abilities, that I wasn't gifted. Slowly, I realized that improvements takes time and everyone's rate of progression differs. Thus, my goal became more to test my limits. 

I hope to use the skills I've learned on this journey in Waterloo to tackle problems with peers. I hope that my determination and ability to persist despite hardships can benefit when doing projects.

**Topic - Webdev**


### Question 2
Briefly describe a group, organization, or community that you have been involved in, are a member of, and/or have contributed to. What contributions have you made as a member of this group? Were you able to lead, influence others and/or influence decisions for the good of the group and its goals? How has your involvement helped make this community better? (900-character limit)

**Planning:**
- Presentations
- Writing solutions
- contest



Since grade 11, I've been actively involved in my schools math club. I started by help create presentations for weekly meetings. I contributed to ideas for math topics and presented them to ~20 students. 

In grade 12, I became in charge of math club. In addition to creating material and presenting, I also organized a curriculum and discussed what should be taught with the execs. I held meetings to brainstorm ideas on what to teach. I distributed tasks for different sections of each slide. 

I also started new initiatives to help students prepare. I organized execs to write solutions to contests such as cemc and cms. Different from official solutions, we intend to provide students with real time thought process and notes so they can learn how to approach the problem through problem solving.

I also connected with execs form other schools in hopes of collaboration and thus connect the high school math community in alberta together.


### Question 3
Describe a situation where you were treated unfairly or witnessed someone else being treated unfairly. What did you do at the time and why? Would you do anything differently if the same situation occurred today? Has this event impacted or changed who you are now and if so, how? (900- character limit)

I started a fundraiser for a non-profit organization helping the homeless. When I was gathering funds, I was surprised to see that a lot less people donated. Though it feels normal, it was very refreshing to see it in person.

A lot of their stories is hidden. It is unfair for such strong prejudice to take place. Being the introvert I once was. It made me realize that there are many problems of society that are brushed over. Experience stuff. It was really my first introduction to real life issues. Before that I was too engrossed in myself and the things happening around me, not really paying attention to other things.

If I were to go back, I would've probably took more time to spread the awareness on a broader scale. Because I feel like peoples voices should be heard. 

### Question 4
What is your primary goal for attending the University of Waterloo? Have you explored, been exposed to, or have experience in the field you plan to pursue and if so, how? Did you turn to anyone for advice in exploring alternative options or backup plans for your goal and if so, how did this person help you? (900-character limit)


Planning:
- See the world
- More opportunity
- Learn from peers

I want to attend Waterloo I often can't find people who share the same interests as me such as CP and math. Waterloo is where good math and CS people meet, so I want to meet friends who is as passionate as I am. When I went to EMACS at waterloo, I was surprised to see that there are students in Canada who are also as interested as I was, and I hope to have that experience throughout college. 

One of my dreams is building cool projects with good friends. I want to belong somewhere and do things that are cool together.

I also want to attend Waterloo because I want to broaden my perspective. I want a breath of fresh air, to learn more about thing happening outside of my city. Waterloo is the home of many CS activities such as the strongest ICPC team in Canada and hackathons such as hack the north. I want to get involved with bigger things that can influence more people.
