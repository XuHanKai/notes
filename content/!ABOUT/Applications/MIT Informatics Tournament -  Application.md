### Hobbies

I like to eat food cause I think food is good but I don't have money to buy food so kinda sad. I also like to watch dramas cause drama = good too. Especially Asian dramas like kdrama and cdramas sometimes, as well as jdramas on the rare occasion. I also like to play basketball and workout in my free time cause gains and make friends. In terms of video games I recently got into Plants vs Zombies cause I wanted to revisit childhood memories. It's pretty fun :). I like to play VALORANT although I quit cause tilt. But I like to watch VALORANT and keep up with the e-sports + streamer scene. I also used to play Smash Ultimate but quit cause I had to move out so I couldn't use my friends switch and my parent won't let me buy a switch :(
Also I like to do math and CS Olympiads in my free time cause it's cool.
